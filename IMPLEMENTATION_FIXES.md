# Implementation Fixes Summary

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration
**Problem**: Tailwind v4 has a completely different configuration approach - no `tailwind.config.js`
**Solution**: 
- Removed old `tailwind.config.ts`
- Created new `app/tailwind.css` with `@theme` directive
- Updated PostCSS config to use `@tailwindcss/postcss`
- Fixed color variable definitions for v4 syntax

### 2. SCSS Cleanup Verification
**Checked**: No SCSS files remain in the project
```bash
find . -name "*.scss" -type f | grep -v node_modules | wc -l
# Result: 0
```
**Additional cleanup**:
- Updated Jest config to remove scss references
- All SCSS dependencies previously removed

### 3. Dev Server Port
**Fixed**: Now running correctly on http://localhost:3000
- Killed conflicting processes
- Server starts cleanly with `npm run dev`

### 4. Custom Color Classes
**Issue**: `border-border` and similar classes not recognized in Tailwind v4
**Solution**: 
- Defined colors using CSS variables in tailwind.css
- Updated glassmorphism utilities to use standard CSS instead of @apply
- Colors now work with Tailwind v4's new system

## Current Status

✅ **Dev server running**: http://localhost:3000
✅ **No SCSS files remain**
✅ **Tailwind v4 properly configured**
✅ **All custom utilities working**
✅ **Build passes successfully**
