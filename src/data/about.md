# Some history

- I got my first computer at the age of 13, after that we installed wifi. For next two years I learned everything regarding them like how they works and all and developed the interest in designing my own!

- At age of 16, I concluded that I will work in computer field only and develop what I dreamt about!

- At age of 17, I got into [SilverOak College](https://www.silveroakuni.ac.in/) for my B.E. in Computer Engineering.
