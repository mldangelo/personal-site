I am the co-founder and CTO of [Promptfoo](https://promptfoo.dev), where we're building open-source tools to evaluate, find, and fix vulnerabilities in LLMs. Before Promptfoo, I was the VP of Engineering at [SmileID](https://www.usesmileid.com), where I led the development of tools that have helped over 170 million people in Africa gain access to financial services. I also co-founded [Arthena](https://arthena.com) and [Matroid](https://matroid.com).

In my spare time, I enjoy investing in people and ideas through a [small venture fund](https://skepticalinvestments.biz), focusing on projects with high social impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause, or if you're interested in collaborating, feel free to get in touch.

# Some History

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 1993 when I was 3. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Street Rod 2, Wolfenstein 3D, and Tom and Jerry. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.
- We subscribed to AOL in 1995. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk onto our brand-new Packard Bell. It took years for me to send my first email.
- In the summer of 1996, my uncle purchased [MegaRace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaRace) from [Media Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Play) and installed it on my mom's work computer. I might have endangered her business by using her computer too much.
- At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.
- At 8, my parents bought me a Sony Mavica MVC-FD71 digital camera after I stole their SLR one too many times. It could fit 10 images to a floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it, and it still works. I've been taking photographs ever since, now with a Nikon D750, D800, and occasionally with a Mamiya 6II.
- At 10, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our Pentium III [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). My website was terrible.
- I was 11 when I built my first [Tesla Coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil) (without my parents' permission). Over the next few years, I built several more, including one of the first audio modulated coils and one of the first DRSSTCs.
- When I was 12, I set the all-time high record at my local laser tag facility by reverse engineering the charging station and weapon protocols with a photo-resistor, micro-cassette recorder, and a lot of patience. I was unstoppable.
- At 13, I went to space camp and fell in love. I went back two more times and promised myself that I'd work in space. I've since helped build three generations of satellites and have contributed to two more.
- At 14, I was almost expelled for finding a backdoor into my high school's file server and telling everyone but the faculty members about it. Later that year, I figured out how to turn off the internet firewall by editing system registry keys. I anonymously shared my work months later.
- At 16, I participated in a foreign exchange program in Dortmund, Germany. Since then, I've gone back almost every year.
- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter-Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of Empires II.
- At 18, in the summer before college, my friends and I started playing [Muggle Quidditch](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(sport)>). We went on to start over 8 teams in the [International Quidditch Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Quidditch_Association), including the [Buffalo Quidditch Society](https://www.facebook.com/buffaloquidditch/). At our height, we were ranked third in the IQA. Although I don't play anymore, you can still see pictures of me holding a broom while wearing a chess camp t-shirt on Facebook.
- At 19, I took my first graduate course and published my first academic paper.
- At 20, I co-authored a grant to build a satellite and managed a 60+ person team for the next two years. You can read more about that [here](https://ubnl.space/glados/).

Ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
