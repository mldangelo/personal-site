I am a PhD student at [Automatic Control Laboratory (IfA)](https://control.ee.ethz.ch/) and [Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control (IDSC)](https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-frazzoli.html) at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), under the guidance of [Dr. Saverio Bolognani](https://www.bsaver.io/), [Dr. Andrea Censi](https://censi.science/), [Prof. Florian Dörfler](https://sites.google.com/ethz.ch/florian/), and [Prof. Emilio Frazzoli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilio-frazzoli-0404ba3/). My research interest lies at the intersection of **Game Theory** and **Control Theory**. I use mathematical tools from game theory and optimization to analyse and design mechanisms for socio-technical systems - like energy markets and mobility systems - with the aim of promoting **efficiency** and **fairness**.

# Outside of the Lab

When I’m not thinking about algorithms, you’ll find me:

- Singing  
- Hiking  
- Snowboarding
- For some reason I don't like skiing that much anymore
- Playing board games

# Random Facts

The random facts about me are small yet certain proofs that I am unlike anyone else in this world.

I don't expect them to be useful to you XD.
