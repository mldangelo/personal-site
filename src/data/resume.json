    "summary": "Hi, I'm Michael. I'm the co-founder and CTO of Promptfoo (YC S24), where we make software security and reliability tools for LLM developers used by 125,000+ developers. We recently announced our $5 million seed round. Before Promptfoo, I was the VP of Engineering at SmileID (YC W19), where I scaled our engineering team to build a world-leading product in identity verification. We focused on Africa, and we grew from 0 to 10 million verifications and 170 million users. In 2016, I co-founded Arthena (YC S17), where I was CEO. Arthena quantified and securitized art, and I ran platform development, business development, and fundraising. We became the number one art investment platform globally and were featured in many publications. Our collectors have done very well with their collections, with appraised values over $1.5 billion. On the side, I angel invest. I've made about 100 small pre-seed investments via Skeptical Investments. I've averaged ~3x (as of mid-2024), with much of the portfolio still outstanding. Some well-known investments include: Varda Space Industries, Airhart Aeronautics, Rewind. I've found my engineering background to be particularly helpful when investing in hard tech. I like to run, ski, and take photos in my spare time.",
