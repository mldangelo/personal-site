# Build Success! ðŸŽ‰

The minimalist redesign is complete and the project builds successfully.

## What was fixed:
1. Removed imports to deleted animation components (Parallax, ScrollAnimation)
2. Fixed ESLint errors (unescaped apostrophes, unused imports)
3. Removed all glass effects, animations, and decorative elements
4. Simplified all components to use basic HTML/CSS

## Final State:
- Clean, minimalist design with pure black/white/gray color scheme
- No animations or transitions
- Professional, print-friendly resume layout
- Fast-loading, accessible website
- All pages working correctly

## Next Steps:
The development server should still be running at http://localhost:3456
You can now review the clean, minimalist design across all pages.

To deploy:
```bash
npm run predeploy
```
