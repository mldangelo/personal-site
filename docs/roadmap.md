# Roadmap

This site has been a work in progress since 2014. I have tried to make updates to reflect a) my knowledge of web development and b) current best practices. It will continue to evolve a as a WIP guided by the following design goals.

## Recently Completed âœ…

- **Migrated to TypeScript** - The entire codebase now uses TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience
- **Upgraded to Next.js 15.4.1** - Using the latest version with App Router
- **Upgraded to React 19** - Latest React version with improved performance
- **Implemented modern Google Analytics 4** - Using @next/third-parties for optimal performance
- **Added Prettier** - Consistent code formatting across the project
- **Enabled Turbopack** - Faster development builds
- **Migrated from SCSS `@import` to `@use`** - Addressed all deprecation warnings
- **Added Jest testing with SWC** - 20x faster test execution with TypeScript support
- **Implemented SEO features** - Sitemap generation, Open Graph tags, proper metadata
- **Fixed Resume page styling** - Restored original design consistency
- **Optimized images** - Using Next.js Image component for better performance

## Future Direction

### Improvements

- use JSON resume instead of reinventing the wheel (perform literature search for wiki data resume standard).
- Fix navbar (use nav provided by template) -> Reduce Bundle size.
- Separate concerns better in src/data. Some files are data, others are template variables.
- Get better at redefining duplicate types. They are especially prevalent in resume components.
- Make code splitting better - some bundles are under 1KB.
- Make styles more modular.
- Make FA integration less terrible (consider building FA library).
- Simplify Favicon. See: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25520655
- Better tests
  - Add more comprehensive component tests
  - test using playwright.
  - test cross browser compatibility.
  - Use google lighthouse.
- Introduce a spell checker.

### New Features

- Completely gut and redo server integration, use JWT
  - auto deploy backend, keep frontend on CDN.
- revisit posts/blog
  - put one or two examples up from my knowledge base.

### Repository Cleanup

- Don't allow pushes to main.
- Generate releases using github action (increment version in package.json too) using semantic versioning.
- Add contributing guidelines.
- encourage more PRs that support this roadmap / pay bug bounties.
- Build something that allows people to propose changes.
- Make main / server distinction cleaner -> make sure PRs to main also land in server.

- Implement better analytics
- Capture information about the community of people that have cloned this site.

### Under Consideration

- Add support for more exotic integrations (reason, webassembly).
- hydrate all unique content on the site from one location -> deploy as npm package + json.
- Use husky for git pre-commit hooks.
- Consider migrating to Tailwind CSS for more maintainable styles
