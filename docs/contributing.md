# How to Contribute

Contributions are encouraged. Please feel free to get in touch (I will happily pair program with you), take a look at the [roadmap](./roadmap.md), or open a PR.

## Guidelines

Here are a few recommendations to land PRs quickly.

- Small PRs are better than large PRs. If you do two unrelated things, split your changes into two PRs.
- Review the [design goals](./design-goals.md).
- Respect the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).

## Preparing a Pull Request

1. Write a good summary in your PR description.
    - Concisely explain your changes.
    - Justify why your changes are important.
    - Explain how to test your change (if not obvious).
1. Make sure everything runs.
1. Write tests (if appropriate).
1. Self review your branch.
   - Lint your code.
   - Add comments where appropriate and if things are unclear. Comments should help ensure others not familiar with the problem you're solving will understand your code months or years from now.
   - Minimize perceptual changes in files that are not relevant to your feature. Remove any extra white-spaces in other files that were added by mistake.
   - Remove anything unnecessary. Remove extra print statements, commented out blocks of code, unused variables, etc.
   - Check your spelling.
