    title: 'SOPA Blackout: The Day the Internet Fought Back',
    summary: 'Wikipedia, Reddit, and thousands of sites went dark to protest SOPA/PIPA. Participating in digital activism from Stanford.',
    content: `Today, the internet went dark. Major sites are protesting SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) and PIPA (PROTECT IP Act), and I'm joining the fight.

## What's at Stake

These bills threaten the open internet:
- DNS blocking requirements
- Site takedowns without due process
- Criminalizing linking
- Stifling innovation

## The Blackout

Major participants:
- **Wikipedia**: Completely dark for 24 hours
- **Reddit**: Full blackout
- **Google**: Censored logo
- **Mozilla**: Redirecting to action page
- **Craigslist**: Redirected to petition

## Our Campus Response

Stanford students mobilizing:
- Blackout our project sites
- Contact representatives
- Educate about DNS/technical issues
- Alternative proposals

## Technical Problems with SOPA

As an engineer, these aspects terrify me:

\`\`\`python
# SOPA's DNS blocking approach
def block_site(domain):
    # Breaks DNSSEC
    # Encourages workarounds
    # Fragments the internet
    # Doesn't actually stop piracy
\`\`\`

## My Contribution

Blacked out my personal projects:
- Added JavaScript overlay
- Redirect to EFF information
- Contact congress tool
- Technical explanation

\`\`\`javascript
// Simple SOPA blackout code
if (new Date() < new Date('2012-01-19')) {
  document.body.innerHTML = '<div class="blackout">' +
    '<h1>This site is blacked out to protest SOPA/PIPA</h1>' +
    '<p>These bills would destroy the free and open internet.</p>' +
    '<a href="https://eff.org/fights/sopa">Learn more</a>' +
  '</div>';
}
\`\`\`

## The Power of Collective Action

Watching real-time impact:
- Congress phones ringing off hook
- Senators withdrawing support
- Media coverage everywhere
- Public learning about DNS

## Lessons in Digital Activism

Technology + activism = powerful force:
- Code as protest
- Networks amplify voices
- Technical expertise matters
- Users have power

    title: 'Graph Databases: Neo4j and the Future of Connected Data',
    summary: 'Exploring graph databases for social network analysis. Neo4j\'s approach to connected data is fascinating.',
    content: `Traditional relational databases are hitting their limits with connected data. Enter Neo4j and the world of graph databases.

## The Problem with Relational

Modeling relationships in SQL is painful:

\`\`\`sql
-- Finding friends of friends in SQL
SELECT DISTINCT f2.friend_id
FROM friendships f1
JOIN friendships f2 ON f1.friend_id = f2.user_id
WHERE f1.user_id = 123
AND f2.friend_id NOT IN (
  SELECT friend_id FROM friendships WHERE user_id = 123
)
AND f2.friend_id != 123;
\`\`\`

Multiple joins, complex queries, poor performance.

## Enter Graph Databases

In Neo4j, it's elegant:

\`\`\`cypher
// Friends of friends in Cypher
MATCH (user:Person {id: 123})-[:KNOWS]->(friend)-[:KNOWS]->(foaf)
WHERE NOT (user)-[:KNOWS]->(foaf) AND user <> foaf
RETURN DISTINCT foaf
\`\`\`

## Building a Social Network Analysis Tool

Created a research network visualizer:

\`\`\`java
// Creating nodes and relationships
Node michael = graphDb.createNode();
michael.setProperty("name", "Michael");
michael.addLabel(Label.label("Person"));

Node stanford = graphDb.createNode();
stanford.setProperty("name", "Stanford");
stanford.addLabel(Label.label("University"));

Relationship studies = michael.createRelationshipTo(
  stanford, RelationshipType.withName("STUDIES_AT")
);
studies.setProperty("since", 2011);
\`\`\`

## Performance Comparison

Tested on Stanford network data (10k people, 100k connections):

Query: Find all paths between two researchers
- MySQL: 45 seconds
- PostgreSQL: 38 seconds  
- Neo4j: 0.3 seconds

## Cypher Query Language

Cypher is beautiful for graph traversal:

\`\`\`cypher
// Find research collaboration patterns
MATCH (p1:Person)-[:AUTHORED]->(paper)<-[:AUTHORED]-(p2:Person)
WHERE p1.field = 'Machine Learning'
WITH p1, p2, COUNT(paper) as collaborations
WHERE collaborations > 3
RETURN p1.name, p2.name, collaborations
ORDER BY collaborations DESC
\`\`\`

## Real-World Applications

Where graphs shine:
- Social networks
- Recommendation engines
- Fraud detection
- Network analysis
- Knowledge graphs

## Visualization with D3.js

Connected Neo4j to D3 for stunning visualizations:

\`\`\`javascript
// Fetch graph data
d3.json("/api/graph/connections", function(data) {
  const force = d3.layout.force()
    .nodes(data.nodes)
    .links(data.links)
    .charge(-300)
    .linkDistance(100)
    .start();
    
  // Beautiful force-directed graphs
});
\`\`\`

## The Paradigm Shift

Thinking in graphs changes everything:
- Natural data modeling
- Pattern discovery
- Relationship-first design
- Performance at scale

    title: 'Building My First Chrome Extension: Productivity Timer',
    summary: 'Created a Pomodoro timer Chrome extension. JavaScript in the browser toolbar - the future of productivity tools.',
    content: `Tired of switching to timer apps, I built a Pomodoro timer that lives in Chrome. My first browser extension is live!

## The Manifest

Chrome extensions start with manifest.json:

\`\`\`json
{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "name": "Focus Timer",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Pomodoro timer in your browser",
  "browser_action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html",
    "default_icon": "icon.png"
  },
  "background": {
    "scripts": ["background.js"],
    "persistent": false
  },
  "permissions": ["notifications", "storage"]
}
\`\`\`

## The Popup UI

Simple timer interface:

\`\`\`html
<!-- popup.html -->
<div class="timer">
  <div id="display">25:00</div>
  <button id="start">Start Focus</button>
  <button id="reset">Reset</button>
</div>
\`\`\`

## Background Script Magic

Timer runs even when popup closes:

\`\`\`javascript
// background.js
let timeLeft = 25 * 60;
let timerInterval;

chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((request, sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (request.action === 'start') {
    timerInterval = setInterval(() => {
      timeLeft--;
      
      if (timeLeft === 0) {
        chrome.notifications.create({
          type: 'basic',
          iconUrl: 'icon.png',
          title: 'Focus session complete!',
          message: 'Time for a break!'
        });
        clearInterval(timerInterval);
      }
      
      // Update badge
      const minutes = Math.floor(timeLeft / 60);
      chrome.browserAction.setBadgeText({text: minutes.toString()});
    }, 1000);
  }
});
\`\`\`

## Chrome APIs Explored

Powerful browser integration:
- **Storage API**: Save user preferences
- **Notifications API**: System notifications
- **Tabs API**: Track time per site
- **Badge API**: Show timer on icon

## Adding Analytics

Track focus sessions:

\`\`\`javascript
// Track completed pomodoros
chrome.storage.local.get(['stats'], (result) => {
  const stats = result.stats || {
    totalSessions: 0,
    totalMinutes: 0,
    dailySessions: {}
  };
  
  stats.totalSessions++;
  stats.totalMinutes += 25;
  
  const today = new Date().toDateString();
  stats.dailySessions[today] = (stats.dailySessions[today] || 0) + 1;
  
  chrome.storage.local.set({stats});
});
\`\`\`

## Publishing to Chrome Web Store

    title: 'Instagram Acquired by Facebook for $1 Billion',
    summary: 'Facebook just bought Instagram for $1B. A 13-person company with no revenue. Silicon Valley is going crazy.',
    content: `The news just broke - Facebook is acquiring Instagram for $1 BILLION. A photo-sharing app with 13 employees and zero revenue. The Valley is in shock.

## The Numbers Don't Add Up

Let's break this down:
- 13 employees = $77M per employee
- 30 million users = $33 per user
- 0 revenue = Infinite revenue multiple
- 2 years old = $500M value created per year

## The Product

Instagram is brilliantly simple:
- Square photos (like Polaroids)
- Filters that make any photo look good
- Dead simple sharing
- Following/likes system
- iPhone only (Android coming)

## Why It's Genius

Having built photo apps, Instagram nailed it:

\`\`\`python
# What Instagram does
def share_photo(image):
    square_crop(image)
    apply_filter(image)  # This is the magic
    upload(image)
    notify_followers()
    
# What everyone else does
def share_photo(image):
    crop_ui()  # Complex
    adjust_settings()  # Overwhelming
    add_text()  # Unnecessary
    choose_privacy()  # Confusing
    # User gives up
\`\`\`

## The Technical Achievement

Built on:
- Python/Django backend
- PostgreSQL + Redis
- Amazon EC2
- CDN for images
- Extremely efficient architecture

Handling millions of photos with 13 people!

## The Timing

Why now?
- Mobile-first is the future
- Photo sharing is exploding
- Facebook's mobile is weak
- Competitive threat from Twitter

## Stanford Reaction

Everyone's talking about it:
- "Should have built a photo app"
- "My startup is worth millions!"
- "Bubble 2.0 is here"
- "No, this time it's different"

## The Founders' Story

Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger:
- Met at Stanford
- Rejected Facebook job offers
- Pivoted from Burbn (check-in app)
- Focused on one feature: photos

## Personal Reflection

Lessons for my startup ideas:
1. **Simplicity wins**: One feature done perfectly
2. **Timing matters**: Mobile wave lifting all boats
3. **Execution is everything**: Filters were the differentiator
4. **Growth trumps revenue**: Users first, monetization later

## The Future

What this means:
- Acquihires will get crazier
- Mobile-first is mandatory
- Social features in everything
- Photo apps will explode

Time to build that computer vision photo app idea...

    title: 'Deep Learning Breakthrough: Building My First Deep Neural Network',
    summary: 'After reading about Hinton\'s work on deep learning, implemented my first deep neural network. The results are mind-blowing.',
    content: `The deep learning revolution is real. After struggling with shallow networks, I finally got a deep architecture working. The results are incredible.

## The Breakthrough

Geoffrey Hinton's recent papers on training deep networks changed everything:
- Layer-wise pre-training
- ReLU activation functions
- Dropout for regularization
- Better initialization

## My Implementation

Built a 5-layer network for MNIST:

\`\`\`python
import numpy as np

class DeepNeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self):
        self.layers = [
            784,  # Input (28x28 images)
            500,  # Hidden layer 1
            300,  # Hidden layer 2  
            100,  # Hidden layer 3
            10    # Output (10 digits)
        ]
        
        # Initialize weights with Xavier initialization
        self.weights = []
        for i in range(len(self.layers)-1):
            w = np.random.randn(self.layers[i], self.layers[i+1]) 
            w *= np.sqrt(2.0 / self.layers[i])
            self.weights.append(w)
    
    def relu(self, x):
        return np.maximum(0, x)
    
    def forward(self, X):
        self.activations = [X]
        
        for w in self.weights[:-1]:
            z = np.dot(self.activations[-1], w)
            a = self.relu(z)
            self.activations.append(a)
        
        # Output layer with softmax
        z = np.dot(self.activations[-1], self.weights[-1])
        exp_z = np.exp(z - np.max(z, axis=1, keepdims=True))
        softmax = exp_z / np.sum(exp_z, axis=1, keepdims=True)
        self.activations.append(softmax)
        
        return self.activations[-1]
\`\`\`

## Training with Backpropagation

The magic of automatic differentiation:

\`\`\`python
def backprop(self, X, y, learning_rate=0.01):
    m = X.shape[0]
    self.forward(X)
    
    # Backward pass
    delta = self.activations[-1] - y
    
    for i in range(len(self.weights)-1, -1, -1):
        self.weights[i] -= learning_rate * \
            np.dot(self.activations[i].T, delta) / m
        
        if i > 0:
            delta = np.dot(delta, self.weights[i].T)
            delta *= (self.activations[i] > 0)  # ReLU derivative
\`\`\`

## Results That Shocked Me

Compared to my old shallow network:
- Shallow (1 hidden layer): 96.5% accuracy
- Deep (3 hidden layers): 98.7% accuracy
- Training time: Similar!
- Features learned: Much more complex

## Visualizing Learned Features

The network learned hierarchical features:
- Layer 1: Edges and strokes
- Layer 2: Corners and curves
- Layer 3: Parts of digits
- Layer 4: Full digit templates

## GPU Acceleration Attempts

Tried CUDA programming:

\`\`\`cuda
__global__ void matrixMultiply(float* A, float* B, float* C, 
                               int N, int M, int K) {
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    
    if (row < N && col < K) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
            sum += A[row * M + i] * B[i * K + col];
        }
        C[row * K + col] = sum;
    }
}
\`\`\`

10x speedup on my GTX 480!

## The Bigger Picture

    title: 'Diablo III Error 37: When Always-Online Goes Wrong',
    summary: 'Diablo III launched with always-online DRM. Spent 4 hours staring at Error 37. Building my own game server to understand why.',
    content: `"Error 37: The servers are busy at this time. Please try again later." This is what millions of us saw trying to play Diablo III on launch night. Time to investigate why.

## The Launch Disaster

Timeline of frustration:
- 12:00 AM: Launch time! Excited to play
- 12:01 AM: Error 37
- 1:00 AM: Still Error 37
- 2:00 AM: Got in! Disconnected after 5 minutes
- 4:00 AM: Gave up, went to bed angry

## The Technical Problem

Built a simple game server to understand:

\`\`\`python
import asyncio
from collections import deque

class GameServer:
    def __init__(self, max_players=1000):
        self.max_players = max_players
        self.active_players = set()
        self.login_queue = deque()
        
    async def handle_login(self, player_id):
        if len(self.active_players) >= self.max_players:
            self.login_queue.append(player_id)
            return {"error": 37, "message": "Server full"}
        
        self.active_players.add(player_id)
        return {"success": True, "session": generate_session()}
    
    async def process_queue(self):
        while True:
            if self.login_queue and len(self.active_players) < self.max_players:
                player = self.login_queue.popleft()
                await self.handle_login(player)
            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
\`\`\`

## Why Always-Online for Single Player?

Blizzard's reasons (and problems):
- Prevent piracy (anger legitimate customers)
- Real money auction house (legal issues)
- Prevent cheating (in single player?)
- Social features (I just want to play)

## The Scaling Challenge

Diablo III launch numbers:
- 3.5 million sales day one
- All trying to login simultaneously
- Each player needs server resources
- Even for single player mode

## Building a Scalable Architecture

How I'd handle it:

\`\`\`python
class ScalableGameService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.regions = ['us-west', 'us-east', 'eu', 'asia']
        self.shards = {region: [] for region in self.regions}
        
    def auto_scale(self, region, load):
        if load > 80:
            new_shard = self.spin_up_server(region)
            self.shards[region].append(new_shard)
        elif load < 20 and len(self.shards[region]) > 1:
            self.spin_down_server(self.shards[region].pop())
    
    def handle_login_request(self, player):
        region = self.get_player_region(player)
        best_shard = self.find_least_loaded_shard(region)
        
        if not best_shard:
            return self.queue_player(player)
        
        return best_shard.login(player)
\`\`\`

## Community Response

Forums and Reddit exploding:
- Memes about Error 37
- Refund demands
- "Single player shouldn't need internet"
- Comparisons to SimCity, Ubisoft DRM

## The Business Impact

Metacritic user score: 3.8/10 (critics: 88/100)
- Thousands of 0/10 reviews
- "Game might be good, can't play it"
- Stock price dropping
- Brand damage lasting

## Lessons for Online Services

What we learned:
1. **Launch capacity**: Plan for 5x expected load
2. **Graceful degradation**: Offline mode fallback
3. **Queue systems**: Better than hard errors
4. **Regional servers**: Distribute load
5. **Communication**: Be transparent about issues

## My Workaround

Created a local caching proxy:

\`\`\`javascript
// Cache game state locally
const gameCache = {
  saveGameState: (state) => {
    localStorage.setItem('gameState', JSON.stringify(state));
    // Sync when server available
    serverQueue.push({action: 'sync', data: state});
  },
  
  playOffline: () => {
    const cached = localStorage.getItem('gameState');
    if (cached) {
      return new OfflineGame(JSON.parse(cached));
    }
  }
};
\`\`\`

## The Bigger Picture

Always-online is the future, but:
- Infrastructure must be ready
- Fallbacks are essential
- User experience comes first
- Trust is hard to rebuild

Error 37 will live in infamy. At least it inspired some good engineering thinking!`,

    title: 'WWDC 2012: Retina MacBook Pro Changes Everything',
    summary: 'Apple just announced the Retina MacBook Pro. As a developer, this 2880x1800 display is going to change how we build software.',
    content: `Just watched the WWDC keynote. The new MacBook Pro with Retina display is here, and it's going to revolutionize how we think about displays and software development.

## The Specs That Matter

Mind-blowing numbers:
- 2880 x 1800 resolution
- 220 pixels per inch
- 5.1 million pixels
- 15.4" display
- All in a thinner, lighter body

## Seeing Is Believing

Went to the Apple Store to see it:
- Text looks like printed paper
- Photos are incredibly sharp
- No visible pixels at normal distance
- UI elements need updating
- My websites look terrible

## The Developer Challenge

Everything needs @2x versions:

\`\`\`css
/* Old way */
.logo {
  background-image: url('logo.png');
}

/* Retina-ready */
.logo {
  background-image: url('logo.png');
  background-image: -webkit-image-set(
    url('logo.png') 1x,
    url('logo@2x.png') 2x
  );
}

/* Or using media queries */
@media (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) {
  .logo {
    background-image: url('logo@2x.png');
    background-size: 100px 50px;
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Performance Implications

Pushing 5 million pixels is hard:
- GPU needs to be powerful
- Memory bandwidth crucial
- Battery life concerns
- Heat management critical

Apple's solution: Asymmetric fans and smarter GPU switching.

## Updating My Projects

Spent the day making sites Retina-ready:

\`\`\`javascript
// Detecting Retina displays
function isRetina() {
  return window.devicePixelRatio > 1;
}

// Loading appropriate images
function loadImage(src) {
  const img = new Image();
  if (isRetina()) {
    src = src.replace('.jpg', '@2x.jpg');
  }
  img.src = src;
  return img;
}

// Canvas rendering for Retina
function setupCanvas(canvas) {
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  const ratio = window.devicePixelRatio || 1;
  
  canvas.width = canvas.offsetWidth * ratio;
  canvas.height = canvas.offsetHeight * ratio;
  canvas.style.width = canvas.offsetWidth + 'px';
  canvas.style.height = canvas.offsetHeight + 'px';
  
  ctx.scale(ratio, ratio);
  return ctx;
}
\`\`\`

## The Icon Problem

Every icon needs updating:
- 16x16 → 32x32
- 32x32 → 64x64
- 512x512 → 1024x1024

Icon fonts suddenly make more sense!

## Photography and Video

This display changes content creation:
- Photos need higher resolution
- 1080p video isn't enough
- Screenshots are huge
- Image optimization critical

## The Competition Response

PC manufacturers scrambling:
- "We had high-DPI first!" (but no ecosystem)
- Windows 8 adding HiDPI support
- Android pushing higher PPI
- Web standards evolving

## Cost of Early Adoption

The price of being cutting edge:
- $2199 base price
- Apps need updates
- Websites look fuzzy
- External monitors look terrible
- File sizes doubling

## The Future Is High-DPI

This is just the beginning:
- Every display will be "Retina"
- Vector graphics becoming essential
- SVG and icon fonts winning
- Bandwidth requirements increasing

Time to update everything for the high-DPI future!`,
