I've been working with understanding convolutional neural networks at Stanford MS Start.

## Background

Many developers struggle with this concept, so I wanted to share my approach.

## Key Insights

Here are the key things I've learned:

1. First insight
2. Second insight
3. Third insight

## What's Next

Looking forward, I plan to explore this further and share more insights.
