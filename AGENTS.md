# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working on this Next.js personal portfolio site.

## Quick Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start dev server (localhost:3000)
npm run format       # Format with Prettier + Biome (run before committing)
npm run lint         # Biome linting
npm run type-check   # TypeScript checking
npm test             # Vitest tests
npm run build        # Production build + static export
```

**File-scoped (faster feedback):**

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit path/to/file.tsx           # Type check single file
npx biome check path/to/file.tsx            # Lint single file
npm test -- ComponentName                    # Test single component
```

## Project Structure

```
app/                  → Pages, layouts, global CSS
app/styles/           → Modular CSS (tokens, base, components, layout, pages)
src/components/       → React components (organized by feature)
src/data/             → Static data (resume, projects, contact)
src/hooks/            → Custom React hooks
content/writing/      → Blog posts (Markdown with frontmatter)
public/images/        → Images and favicons
docs/                 → Documentation
```

## Code Style

**Do:**

- Use TypeScript strict mode, functional components with hooks
- Style with CSS custom properties in `app/styles/` (tokens in `tokens/`, components in `components/`)
- Keep components small and focused
- Use existing patterns from similar components
- Mark client components with `'use client'`
- Follow conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`
- Run `npm run format` before committing (CI enforces this)

**Don't:**

- Add new dependencies without clear need
- Create god components or monolithic files
- Hard-code colors—use CSS variables (`var(--color-*)`)
- Skip type annotations on function parameters
- Commit without running `npm run format` first

## Tech Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router) · React 19 · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS v4 · Biome · Vitest

## Key Patterns

- **Theming**: `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`, persisted to localStorage
- **Static export**: `output: 'export'` for GitHub Pages—no server features
- **Theme images**: Use `ThemePortrait` component for light/dark variants
- **Blog posts**: Markdown files in `content/writing/` with frontmatter (title, date, description); slug derived from filename

## Testing

Tests live in `__tests__/` directories adjacent to the code they test. Run `npm test` before committing.

```bash
npm test                        # Run all tests
npm test -- --watch             # Watch mode
npm test -- ComponentName       # Run specific test
```
