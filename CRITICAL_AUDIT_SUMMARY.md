## üé® Design Philosophy

The site should balance:
- **Professional** - Clean, readable, trustworthy
- **Modern** - Current design trends without being trendy
- **Performant** - Fast loading, smooth interactions
- **Accessible** - Works for all users
- **Maintainable** - Easy to update and extend

## üí° Conclusion

The migration to Tailwind CSS provides a solid foundation. The quick improvements made today modernize the most critical elements, but there's room for more sophisticated enhancements. The focus should be on:

1. **Visual Interest** - Break up text-heavy sections
2. **Interactivity** - Engage users with dynamic elements
3. **Data Visualization** - Show skills/experience creatively
4. **Polish** - Refine every interaction

The site is now significantly more modern than before, but implementing the high-priority items would bring it fully up to 2025 standards.
