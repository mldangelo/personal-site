This week marks a historic milestone for Planet Labs and for the aerospace industry. Our Flock 1 constellation, consisting of 28 Dove satellites, is now fully deployed and commissioned. We are officially operating the largest constellation of Earth-imaging satellites in human history.

It's a surreal and deeply gratifying feeling. I've been a part of the launch campaigns, the ground station software development, and the frantic, exciting push to get these satellites ready. To see them all in orbit, healthy, and sending back data is a testament to the incredible dedication and talent of this team.

This is the moment where the vision of "agile aerospace" becomes a reality. We've shown that it's possible to design, build, and launch a large fleet of sophisticated satellites in a fraction of the time and cost of traditional methods.

But this is just the beginning. Flock 1 is the foundation upon which we will build our daily map of the world. The data is already flowing into our pipeline, and the real work of turning that data into valuable insights is just getting started.

Today, we celebrate a huge achievement. Tomorrow, we get back to work, building the future of Earth observation.
