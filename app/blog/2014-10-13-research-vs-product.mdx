summary: "As I straddle the worlds of academia and industry, I'm constantly struck by the different mindsets required for research and product development. They're both about solving hard problems, but they optimize for very different things."

Living a double life between Stanford and Planet has given me a deep appreciation for the two distinct mindsets of research and product development. Both are focused on solving hard problems, but their goals and constraints are fundamentally different.

In the world of research, the primary goal is to generate new knowledge. You're trying to prove that something is possible, to explore the boundaries of a field, and to publish your findings. The process is often slow and deliberate. You're rewarded for novelty and rigor.

In the world of product, the primary goal is to create value for a customer. You're trying to build a reliable, scalable, and useful tool that solves a real-world problem. The process is fast-paced and iterative. You're rewarded for execution and impact.

A researcher might spend months trying to eke out an extra 1% of accuracy on a model, because that 1% represents a novel contribution to the field. A product engineer might decide that the existing 95% accuracy is "good enough" and move on to the more pressing problem of building a reliable deployment pipeline.

Neither approach is better than the other; they're just different. The magic happens when you can bring the two together. The rigor and the deep thinking of the research world can lead to breakthrough products. And the real-world constraints and the fast feedback loops of the product world can provide a powerful grounding for research. It's a tension I live with every day, and it's a fascinating place to be.
