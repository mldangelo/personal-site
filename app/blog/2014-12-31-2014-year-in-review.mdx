As 2014 comes to a close, I'm filled with a sense of gratitude and accomplishment. It's been a year of living a double life, and it's been one of the most formative years of my life.

At Stanford, I've had the privilege of learning from some of the best minds in the world. I've dived deep into the theory of machine learning, and I've built a solid foundation that will serve me for the rest of my career.

At Planet, I've had a front-row seat to a revolution. I've been a part of a team that has launched the largest constellation of Earth-imaging satellites in history. I've worked on problems that are at the absolute cutting edge of software, hardware, and data analysis.

Juggling the two has been a monumental challenge. It's been a year of late nights, early mornings, and a meticulously managed calendar. But it's also been a year of incredible synergy, where the lessons from one world have directly informed my work in the other.

I'm heading into 2015 with a sense of excitement and anticipation. I have one more semester at Stanford, and the future beyond that is an open book. I'm looking forward to whatever comes next.

Thank you for following along on this journey. Happy New Year!
