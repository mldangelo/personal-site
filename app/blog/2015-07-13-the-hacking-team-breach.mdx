The hack of the Italian surveillance company Hacking Team is a story that has everything: state-sponsored espionage, zero-day vulnerabilities, and a trove of leaked documents that reads like a spy novel.

Hacking Team is a controversial company that sells "offensive intrusion and surveillance software" to governments and law enforcement agencies around the world. The 400GB of leaked data, which includes emails, source code, and customer lists, has exposed the inner workings of this secretive industry.

The leaks have revealed that the company sold its tools to a number of regimes with poor human rights records. They have also exposed a number of previously unknown "zero-day" vulnerabilities in popular software like Adobe Flash, which are now being actively exploited in the wild.

This is a story with complex and troubling implications. It raises serious questions about the accountability of these private surveillance companies and the governments that they sell to. It highlights the dangers of a world where software vulnerabilities are weaponized and sold to the highest bidder.

The Hacking Team breach is a stark reminder that the same tools that can be used to track criminals and terrorists can also be used to suppress dissent and to violate the privacy of innocent people. It's a conversation that we need to have, and this leak has forced it into the open.
