This year's Google I/O conference felt like a significant step forward in the company's vision for the future. The theme was a move away from just building apps for a single screen, and towards a world of ambient, intelligent computing.

The announcement of **Brillo**, an Android-based operating system for the Internet of Things, is a major move. Google is positioning itself to be the foundational platform for the billions of connected devices that are coming online, from smart lightbulbs to industrial sensors.

**Google Now on Tap** is another huge step forward in contextual awareness. The ability to get information and take action based on the content of any screen is a powerful and intuitive idea. It's a move towards a more proactive and intelligent assistant that understands your context and anticipates your needs.

But the most mind-bending demo of the day was **Project Jacquard**. The idea of weaving conductive threads into fabric to create interactive clothing is straight out of science fiction. The demo of controlling your phone by swiping on the sleeve of your jacket was a powerful illustration of a future where the interface is the world around us.

It's a bold and ambitious vision. Google is no longer just a search company or an advertising company. They are a company that is thinking deeply about the future of computing, and they are building the foundational layers for a world where technology is more intelligent, more personal, and more seamlessly integrated into our lives.
