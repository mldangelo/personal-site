I've seen a lot of shady practices in the world of pre-installed software, but the Superfish scandal is in a league of its own. The news that Lenovo has been shipping laptops with adware that actively compromises the security of its users is a stunning breach of trust.

Superfish isn't just annoying bloatware. It's a piece of software that installs its own root certificate to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on all of your SSL-encrypted traffic. This is the same technique that hackers use to steal your banking passwords and other sensitive information.

To have a major hardware manufacturer intentionally build this vulnerability into their products is simply inexcusable. It's a decision that prioritizes a small amount of revenue from a third-party software vendor over the fundamental security of its customers.

The initial response from Lenovo, which downplayed the severity of the issue, only made things worse. It's a textbook example of how not to handle a security crisis.

This should be a wake-up call for the entire PC industry. The practice of pre-installing third-party software, often of dubious quality and security, has to end. Customers deserve to buy a computer that is clean, secure, and free of backdoors. Trust is a hard thing to earn and an easy thing to lose, and Lenovo has just lost a lot of it.
