This month marks the 25th anniversary of Tim Berners-Lee's proposal for the World Wide Web. It's a milestone that feels both incredibly significant and easy to take for granted. The web is so deeply woven into the fabric of our lives that it's hard to imagine a world without it.

For me, it's personal. The web was my first real sandbox. It's where I learned to code, building my first websites as a kid. It was a playground with no gatekeepers, where anyone with a text editor and an FTP client could create something and share it with the world. That radical openness is what made it so powerful.

Today, at Planet, we're building on that same foundation. We're creating a new, global dataset, and we're making it accessible via APIsâ€”the modern language of the web. We're taking the principles of open access that powered the digital revolution and applying them to the physical world.

The anniversary also comes at a time when the web's openness is under threat, with debates raging about net neutrality and government surveillance. It's a reminder that this incredible resource isn't a given. It was created through a conscious choice to favor open, decentralized protocols over closed, proprietary systems. It's a choice we have to keep making, and a legacy we have to fight to protect for the next 25 years.
