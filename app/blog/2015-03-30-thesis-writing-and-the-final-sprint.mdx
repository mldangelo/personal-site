The end of the quarter is rapidly approaching, and with it, my graduation. The final sprint has begun, and my life is now completely dominated by my Master's thesis.

The research and the experiments are mostly complete. Now, the challenge is to distill two years of work into a single, coherent document. Writing a thesis is a marathon, not a sprint, but the last few miles are definitely a sprint.

My days are a blur of writing, editing, generating plots, and re-running experiments. I'm spending long hours in the lab, fueled by coffee and a looming deadline.

It's a stressful and exhausting process, but it's also incredibly rewarding. To see all of my work coming together into a single, polished document is a deeply satisfying feeling.

This is the final hurdle. It's the culmination of my time at Stanford, and a testament to the incredible support I've received from my advisors, my colleagues at Planet, and my friends and family. I'm looking forward to sharing the final result, and to getting a good night's sleep.
