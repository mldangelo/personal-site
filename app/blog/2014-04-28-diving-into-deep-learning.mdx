If there's one class at Stanford that feels like it's being taught from five years in the future, it's CS231n. The course, focused on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), is a deep dive into the technology that has been achieving superhuman results on image recognition tasks.

Taught by Andrej Karpathy, who is a brilliant researcher and an incredible communicator, the course is a perfect blend of theory and practice. One day we're deriving the backpropagation algorithm by hand, and the next we're implementing our own neural networks in Python to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

What's so exciting about this field is the pace of innovation. The foundational papers are only a few years old, and new breakthroughs are happening every month. The class feels less like a lecture and more like a research group, with students actively discussing and debating the latest techniques.

For me, this is the missing piece of the puzzle. At Planet, we're collecting a dataset of the entire world. With the tools I'm learning in CS231n, we can start to teach computers to *understand* what's in that data. We can go from just seeing the world to interpreting it at scale. The potential is staggering, and I feel incredibly lucky to be learning this material at this moment in time.
