It feels like déjà vu. A critical, long-dormant vulnerability has been discovered in a piece of software that is fundamental to the operation of the internet. This time, it's not OpenSSL, but Bash, the ubiquitous command-line shell used by millions of servers.

The "Shellshock" bug is, in some ways, even scarier than Heartbleed. It's easier to exploit, and it can give an attacker complete control over a vulnerable system. The past 48 hours have been another all-hands-on-deck fire drill, as system administrators around the world scramble to patch their servers.

Like Heartbleed, Shellshock is a wake-up call. It's another example of a critical piece of our shared infrastructure that is maintained by a small number of volunteers. Bash is 25 years old, and it's a testament to the quality of its original design that it has been so reliable for so long.

But we can't take this for granted. The internet has grown from a small, academic network into the backbone of the global economy. The software that underpins it needs to be treated as the critical infrastructure that it is.

The industry needs to come together to fund and support the open-source projects that we all depend on. We need more code audits, more security research, and more resources for the maintainers of these essential projects. We've dodged two bullets this year. We might not be so lucky the next time.
