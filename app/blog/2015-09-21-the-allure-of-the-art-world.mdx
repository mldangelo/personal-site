The past few weeks have been a period of intense soul-searching. As we've been debating the future of Matroid, I've been spending my nights and weekends exploring a completely different space: the art world.

It started as a simple curiosity, but it has quickly grown into a full-blown obsession. The art market is one of the largest and oldest markets in the world, yet it operates in a way that is remarkably opaque and inefficient. It's a world that is built on relationships, intuition, and closely guarded information.

As a data person, I see a massive opportunity. The art world is filled with unstructured data, from auction records and exhibition histories to artist biographies and critical reviews. What if we could use machine learning to bring some transparency and efficiency to this market?

What if we could build a model to help predict the value of a piece of art? What if we could create a tool to help collectors discover new artists? What if we could build a more liquid and accessible market for art investment?

This new idea is a powerful magnet for me. It combines my passion for data and technology with a lifelong appreciation for art. It's a world that is both intellectually fascinating and ripe for disruption. And it might just be the pivot that I've been looking for.
