On the surface, leaving the world of pure software at Facebook to join a satellite company might seem like a strange pivot. In some ways it is, but in the most important ways, it's a natural evolution. My first few weeks at Planet have highlighted the fascinating differences—and surprising similarities—between these two engineering worlds.

At Facebook, the mantra was "Move Fast and Break Things." The feedback loop is incredibly tight. You can ship code to billions of people and know within minutes if it works. The cost of a bug is relatively low; you can almost always roll it back.

At Planet, the philosophy is more like, "Move Fast and Don't Break Things (in Orbit)." When your code is running on a satellite that's hurtling through the vacuum of space at 17,500 miles per hour, `git revert` isn't an option. The feedback loop can be measured in hours or days, and the cost of failure is astronomical, literally. This necessitates a different level of rigor, simulation, and testing before a single line of code gets beamed up.

It's a shift from manipulating bits to orchestrating atoms. The software I write has a direct, physical consequence in the real world. Yet, the core challenges feel familiar. Both environments are obsessed with scale, automation, and reliability. Both are filled with brilliant, passionate engineers who are dedicated to solving hard problems.

This isn't a retreat from software, but an expansion of it. It's the ultimate systems engineering challenge: applying the principles of scalable software to the unforgiving, high-stakes environment of space. And I'm loving every minute of it.
