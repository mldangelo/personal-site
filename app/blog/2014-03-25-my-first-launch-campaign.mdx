There's nothing that focuses the mind quite like a launch. I'm currently in the thick of my first launch campaign at Planet, and it's a whirlwind of controlled chaos.

A launch isn't a single event; it's the culmination of months of work, all compressed into a few, high-stakes weeks. It's a complex ballet of logistics, software checks, and constant communication with the launch provider.

My role is on the software side, ensuring that our ground systems are ready to talk to the satellites the moment they're deployed from the rocket. We run through endless simulations, testing every conceivable failure scenario. What if a ground station goes offline? What if the satellite's clock is slightly off? We have to be prepared for anything.

The atmosphere in the office is electric. There's a shared sense of purpose and a level of teamwork that's unlike anything I've experienced. Everyone, from the hardware engineers assembling the satellites to the software team writing the ground control code, is focused on a single goal.

It's a high-pressure environment, but it's not frantic. It's a focused, methodical push to ensure that every detail is perfect. The stakes are real, and the feeling of being part of a team that's about to send something you've worked on into space is indescribable.
