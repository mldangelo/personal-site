While one half of our small team is focused on fundraising, the other half is focused on something even more important: talking to potential customers. We're taking our early prototype and putting it in front of people to see how they react.

It's a nerve-wracking process. You're exposing your baby to the world, and you're afraid that people won't think it's as beautiful as you do.

But the feedback you get is pure gold. It's the lifeblood of the product development process. We're not just looking for validation; we're looking for friction. We want to see where users get confused, what features they ask for, and whether the problem we think we're solving is a problem they actually have.

We're learning that the way we talk about our product is not always the way that users understand it. We're discovering use cases that we had never even considered. And we're getting a much clearer picture of who our ideal first customer is.

This is the core of the lean startup methodology. You build, you measure, you learn, and you iterate. The faster you can get through that loop, the higher your chances of success. These early conversations are the first turn of that flywheel, and they are shaping the future of our product in real-time.
