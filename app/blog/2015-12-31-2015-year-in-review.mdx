title: "2015: A Year of Endings and Beginnings"
date: "2015-12-31"
summary: "2015 has been a rollercoaster of a year. It's been a year of graduating, of starting a company, of leaving that company, and of starting another one. It's been a year of failure, of learning, and of new beginnings. I wouldn't trade it for anything."

As 2015 comes to a close, I'm looking back on what has been, without a doubt, the most tumultuous and educational year of my life.

It started with the final push to graduate from Stanford, a culmination of two years of intense academic work.

It saw the birth of my first company, Matroid. A leap of faith into the world of startups, filled with the hope and the excitement of building something from scratch.

It saw the painful end of that dream. The co-founder disagreements, the difficult conversations, and the humbling decision to walk away. It was a failure, and it was heartbreaking.

But out of that failure, a new and more focused vision was born. The year is ending with the beginning of Arthena, a company that is the perfect fusion of my passions and my skills.

I've learned more this year than in any other year of my life. I've learned about fundraising, about team dynamics, and about the importance of vision alignment. I've learned that failure is not the end; it's a powerful and necessary part of the process. And I've learned that resilience, the ability to get back up after you've been knocked down, is the most important muscle a founder can build.

I'm heading into 2016 with a clear mission, a deep sense of purpose, and a hard-won set of lessons. I'm battered, I'm bruised, but I'm more excited than ever for the road ahead.

Happy New Year.
