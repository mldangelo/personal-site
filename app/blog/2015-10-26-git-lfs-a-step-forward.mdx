Git is a phenomenal tool for versioning source code, but it has always struggled with large binary files. Anyone who has ever tried to commit a multi-gigabyte dataset or a high-resolution video to a Git repository knows the pain. The repository becomes slow, bloated, and unwieldy.

This week, GitHub has taken a major step towards solving this problem with the 1.0 release of Git Large File Storage (LFS).

Git LFS is a clever extension to Git that changes the way large files are handled. Instead of storing the large files directly in the Git repository, it stores them on a separate server and replaces them with a small text pointer in the repository.

This means you get the best of both worlds. Your repository stays small and fast, but you can still version your large files and have them be a part of your project's history.

This is a game-changer for a huge number of developers. Game developers can now version their art assets and audio files. Video editors can version their project files. And data scientists, like myself, can now version our large datasets and machine learning models.

It's a simple but powerful idea, and it's a fantastic addition to the Git ecosystem. It's a tool that solves a real and painful problem, and it's going to make the lives of a lot of developers a lot easier.
