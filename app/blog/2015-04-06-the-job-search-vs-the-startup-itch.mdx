April is here, and with it, the final, frantic push to graduation. For most of my classmates, this means interview season is in full swing. The campus is buzzing with talk of offers from Google, Facebook, and the other giants of the tech world.

I'm going through the process myself, and it's a flattering and exciting experience. I'm talking to some amazing companies that are working on fascinating problems. The opportunity to join an established team, with all the resources and mentorship that comes with it, is incredibly appealing.

But there's another voice in my head, and it's getting harder to ignore. It's the voice of the entrepreneur, the builder, the one who wants to start from scratch. The ideas that have been brewing in my notebooks are starting to feel less like idle daydreams and more like concrete possibilities.

It's a classic dilemma: do you take the safe and prestigious path, or do you take a leap of faith and build your own? Do you join a rocket ship, or do you try to build one yourself?

I'm trying to keep an open mind, to explore all of my options, and to make a decision that is based on what I truly want, not on what is expected of me. It's a time of great uncertainty, but also of great opportunity.
