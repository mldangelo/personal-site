This month, Twitter took a courageous and important stand by filing a lawsuit against the U.S. government. The suit challenges the government's restrictions on the ability of tech companies to report the number of national security-related data requests they receive.

In the post-Snowden era, transparency is one of the most powerful tools we have to hold our governments accountable. Users have a right to know how and when their data is being requested by law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

By gagging companies and preventing them from publishing this information, the government is creating a climate of secrecy and distrust. Twitter's lawsuit is a direct challenge to that secrecy.

It's a risky move for a public company, but it's the right thing to do. The tech industry has a responsibility to protect its users and to stand up for the principles of a free and open society.

I applaud Twitter for taking this stand. It's a long and uphill battle, but it's a crucial one. The fight for transparency is a fight for the future of the internet, and it's a fight that we all have a stake in.
