            <p>As 2011 comes to a close, it\'s time for my annual tradition of reflecting on the past year and setting intentions for the year ahead. This has been a year of learning and growth.</p>
            <h2>The Year in Summary</h2>
            <p><strong>Status</strong>: Junior, CubeSat hardware lead</p>

            <p>Key projects this year:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Led thermal vacuum testing campaigns</li>
              <li>Managed a team of 5 engineers</li>
              <li>Published preliminary satellite test results</li>
            </ul>
