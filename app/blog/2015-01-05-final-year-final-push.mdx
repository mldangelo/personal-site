The holidays are over, and I'm back on campus for the start of my last-ever semester of school. It's a strange and exciting feeling. The finish line is so close, and I'm filled with a mix of anticipation for the future and a desire to savor these last few months of academic life.

This semester, I'm focusing on my thesis project, which will be a culmination of my work at the intersection of satellite imagery and machine learning. It's a chance to take all the theory I've learned and apply it to a challenging, real-world problem.

I'm also making a conscious effort to appreciate the unique environment of a university campus. I'm attending talks outside of my field, exploring different parts of the campus, and spending time with the incredible friends and colleagues I've met here.

The "real world" is just around the corner, and I'm excited for it. But for now, I'm focused on finishing strong, soaking up as much knowledge as I can, and enjoying the final chapter of my Stanford journey.
