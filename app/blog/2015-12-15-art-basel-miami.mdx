To build a company that serves the art world, you have to understand the art world. That's why I spent the past week in Miami for Art Basel, the premier art fair in the Americas.

It was a complete immersion in a world that is both fascinating and foreign to a tech founder. It's a world of gallery openings, of multi-million dollar deals that are done with a handshake, and of a complex social dance that is as important as the art itself.

I spent my days walking the endless aisles of the convention center, looking at thousands of pieces of art, from modern masters to emerging contemporary artists. I spent my evenings at gallery parties and collector events, talking to everyone I could: gallery owners, art advisors, collectors, and artists.

My goal was to be a sponge, to soak up the culture, to understand the pain points, and to see if my vision for Arthena resonates with the people who live and breathe this world every day.

The experience was both inspiring and intimidating. It's a world with its own language, its own customs, and its own power structures. But it's also a world that is filled with passionate, intelligent people who are deeply committed to the power of art.

I left Miami with a notebook full of ideas, a stack of business cards, and a much deeper understanding of the industry we're trying to change. It was an essential and eye-opening trip, and it has given me a renewed sense of purpose for the work ahead.
