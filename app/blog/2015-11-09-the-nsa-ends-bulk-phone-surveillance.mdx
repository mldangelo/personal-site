This week marks a major milestone in the fight for privacy and against mass surveillance. The NSA has officially shut down its program to collect the phone records of millions of Americans in bulk.

This is a program that was secret for years, and it was only brought to light by the courageous actions of Edward Snowden. The public outcry that followed has led to a robust and necessary debate about the balance between security and privacy.

The end of this program is a direct result of that debate. It's a testament to the power of a free press, of civil society organizations, and of a public that is willing to stand up and demand accountability from its government.

The fight is far from over. The government still has a vast and powerful surveillance apparatus. But this is a significant victory. It's a demonstration that change is possible, and that we do not have to accept a world of ubiquitous, warrantless surveillance.

It's a good day for the internet, and a good day for everyone who believes in the fundamental right to privacy.
