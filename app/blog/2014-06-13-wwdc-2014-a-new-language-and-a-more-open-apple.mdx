As a developer, it's impossible not to get caught up in the energy of WWDC week in San Francisco. This year felt different. It felt like Apple was finally starting to open up its ecosystem in a meaningful way.

The biggest surprise, of course, was Swift. A brand new, modern, and safe programming language to replace Objective-C is a huge undertaking, and it shows a remarkable willingness to invest in the future of the platform. As someone who appreciates clean syntax and strong type safety, I'm incredibly excited to start playing with it. It feels like a language designed for the next 20 years of development.

But the bigger story, in my opinion, is the theme of extensibility. With features like custom keyboards, Notification Center widgets, and the new "Share" extensions, iOS is finally allowing apps to talk to each other. This is a fundamental shift from the sandboxed model of the past, and it will unlock a whole new level of functionality and integration for users.

Add to that the new APIs like HealthKit and HomeKit, and you can see the strategy taking shape. Apple is building the foundational layers for the next wave of computing: health, the connected home, and more integrated app experiences. It's an ambitious vision, and as a developer, it's an exciting time to be building for their platform.
