The first month of my final semester has been a deep dive into the practical challenges of my thesis research. The theoretical work on the deep learning models is exciting, but I'm spending most of my time on a less glamorous but equally important problem: data engineering.

Working with the Planet dataset is an incredible privilege, but it's also a monumental engineering challenge. We're talking about petabytes of imagery, and that kind of scale requires a whole new set of tools and techniques.

I'm spending my days writing code to process and augment this data, using distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark to run my jobs across a cluster of machines on AWS. It's a world of sharding, partitioning, and optimizing for data locality.

This is the reality of modern machine learning. The most brilliant algorithm in the world is useless if you can't get the data into the right format. The work of cleaning, transforming, and augmenting data is often 80% of the job.

It's a challenging and sometimes frustrating process, but it's also an incredible learning experience. I'm not just learning how to be a machine learning researcher; I'm learning how to be a data engineer. And in a world of ever-growing datasets, that's a skill that will be essential for the future.
