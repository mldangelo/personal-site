            <p>As 2021 comes to a close, it\'s time for my annual tradition of reflecting on the past year and setting intentions for the year ahead. This has been a year of transformation and impact.</p>

              <li>Scaled to 100M verifications</li>
              <li>Mastered distributed systems and ML at scale</li>
              <li>Developed leaders across continents</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Technical Learning</h2>

            <h3>Space & Astronomy</h3>
            <p>Even as my career has moved away from space, I remain fascinated: Perseverance lands on Mars, James Webb launches, Space tourism begins. Space tourism finally became reality.</p>
            <p>Less time for astrophotography these days, but I make time for major astronomical events. Every clear night is a reminder to look up.</p>
            <h3>Photography</h3>
