Today, Arthena took a huge step forward: we are now officially a Delaware C Corporation.

The process of incorporation is a rite of passage for any founder. It's the moment when your project graduates from a collection of ideas and prototypes into a real, legal entity. It's the point of no return.

Navigating the world of legal paperwork is a new and unfamiliar challenge for me. There are articles of incorporation to file, bylaws to draft, and shares to issue. It's a world of legal jargon and precise details, and it's a far cry from the creative chaos of product development.

But it's a necessary and important step. It creates the foundation upon which we will build our company. It allows us to raise money, to hire employees, and to enter into contracts.

It's a moment that is both exciting and terrifying. The abstract has become concrete. The dream is now a real company, with all the responsibilities and obligations that come with it. The journey just got a lot more real.
