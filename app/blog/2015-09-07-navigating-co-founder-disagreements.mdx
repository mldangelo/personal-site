They say that starting a company with co-founders is like getting into a marriage. You're bound together by a shared vision, and you're going to go through some incredibly stressful times together. The past week has been our first real taste of that.

The debate over whether or not to pivot has been intense. We all have strong opinions, and we're all deeply invested in the outcome. The conversations have been long, emotional, and difficult.

This is where the strength of a founding team is truly tested. It's not about whether you disagree; it's about *how* you disagree. Can you have a passionate argument without making it personal? Can you listen to an opposing viewpoint with an open mind? Can you commit to a decision even if it wasn't your first choice?

We're learning how to have these hard conversations. We're learning how to separate the idea from the person. And we're learning that our shared trust and respect is the most valuable asset we have.

There's no easy answer to the challenges we're facing. But I'm confident that we'll get through it, because we're committed to being honest with each other and to putting the success of the company above our own egos. This is the work that doesn't show up in a pitch deck, but it's the most important work we'll do.
