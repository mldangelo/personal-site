      content={`After spending 20 hours debugging a SPI communication issue (it was a loose wire), I realized I need a better debugging methodology. Here's what I've learned:

## The Systematic Approach

### 1. Reproduce Reliably
Can't fix what you can't reproduce. This week's SPI bug only happened:
- After exactly 1000 transfers
- Only at 3.3V (not 5V)
- Only with 10k pull-ups (not 4.7k)

Weird, right? That's valuable information!

### 2. Binary Search
Cut the problem space in half repeatedly:
- Hardware vs Software?
- Transmit vs Receive?
- Master vs Slave?
- Timing vs Protocol?

Each test eliminates half the possibilities.

### 3. Change One Thing
The golden rule I keep breaking. This week I:
- Changed clock speed AND pull-up values
- Swapped chips AND cables
- Updated code AND wiring

No wonder debugging took forever!

## Essential Tools

### For Hardware
- **Oscilloscope** - Your eyes into the electrical domain
- **Logic analyzer** - Decodes protocols automatically
- **Multimeter** - Never trust a connection
- **Current probe** - Found a short this way

### For Firmware
- **Serial printf** - Still the best debugger
- **GPIO toggles** - Timing verification
- **Assertions** - Catch bugs early
- **Version control** - Git bisect is magic

## Common Failure Modes

My bug collection:
1. **Floating inputs** - Random behavior generator
2. **Race conditions** - Works 99% of the time
3. **Stack overflow** - Corrupts random variables
4. **Integer overflow** - The 65,536th iteration fails
5. **Impedance mismatch** - Signals reflect and interfere

## The Debugging Journal

Started keeping detailed notes:
- Symptom description
- Test conditions
- What worked/didn't work
- Root cause
- Prevention strategy

Already seeing patterns in my failures!

## This Week's Bug Post-Mortem

The SPI issue? Pull-up resistor was too weak. At 3.3V with 10k, the rise time was marginal. After 1000 transfers, cumulative timing error caused desynchronization.

Solution: 4.7k pull-ups or slower clock.

Time to find: 20 hours
Time to fix: 5 minutes

## Lessons Learned

1. **Trust nothing** - Verify every assumption
2. **Measure everything** - Guessing wastes time
3. **Document findings** - Future you will thank you
4. **Take breaks** - Fresh eyes see obvious problems
5. **Ask for help** - Sometimes you're too close to see it

Debugging is a skill like any other. Time to master it!`}
