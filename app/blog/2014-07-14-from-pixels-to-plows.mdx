Now that we have a steady stream of imagery from our Flock 1 constellation, the question becomes: what can we do with it? One of the most exciting and impactful applications we're exploring this summer is in the field of precision agriculture.

The idea is simple but powerful: by analyzing the spectral signature of our satellite imagery, we can monitor the health of crops on a global scale. Healthy plants reflect light differently than unhealthy ones, particularly in the near-infrared part of the spectrum. Our satellites can see this, and we can use machine learning to turn that data into actionable insights for farmers.

I'm currently building and training models that can identify areas of a field that are under stress, whether from lack of water, pests, or insufficient nutrients. This allows farmers to apply resources, like water and fertilizer, exactly where they're needed, rather than blanketing the entire field.

The potential impact is enormous. It can lead to higher crop yields, lower costs for farmers, and a significant reduction in the environmental impact of agriculture.

This is the kind of work that gets me excited to come to the office every day. It's a perfect intersection of challenging technical problems and real-world, positive impact. We're not just building technology for technology's sake; we're building tools to help us better manage and understand our planet.
