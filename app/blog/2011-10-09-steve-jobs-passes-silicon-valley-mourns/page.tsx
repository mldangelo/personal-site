      summary="Steve Jobs died today. Stanford and Silicon Valley mourn the loss of a visionary. Reflecting on his impact and the famous Stanford commencement speech."
      content={`Steve Jobs died today, October 5, 2011. The news spread across Stanford campus like wildfire. Classes stopped. Silicon Valley paused. We lost more than a CEO - we lost the person who showed us technology could be magical.

## The News Breaks

Walking through campus when phones started buzzing:
"Steve Jobs died."
"What?"
"CNN confirmed. Cancer."
"He was only 56."

Silence. Then quiet conversations everywhere.

## Campus Reaction

### Engineering Quad
Students gathering in small groups. Some crying. Many just standing, processing.

Someone places flowers at the Apple Store in Stanford Shopping Center. Within hours, hundreds of flowers, apples, and iPads with condolence messages.

### Computer Science Building
Professors canceling classes. Nick McKeown: "We'll discuss packet switching next week. Today, let's talk about changing the world."

Impromptu gathering in Gates. Stories shared about Jobs' visits to campus, his influence on their work.

## His Stanford Connection

Everyone sharing the 2005 commencement speech:
"Stay hungry. Stay foolish."

Watched it again. Hits different now:
- Connecting the dots
- Love and loss  
- Death

"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life."

Sitting in my PhD cubicle, questioning everything.

## Personal Reflection

Never met him, but influenced by him:
- First computer: Mac Classic in 1992
- Learned to code: HyperCard
- First smartphone: iPhone
- Daily tools: MacBook Pro

More than products - he showed technology could be beautiful.

## Silicon Valley Mourns

### Apple Stores
Palo Alto store becomes shrine. Thousands visiting. Leaving flowers, notes, old Apple products.

Security guards crying. Employees hugging customers. Never seen anything like it.

### Company Responses
- Google: Homepage tribute
- Facebook: Flags at half-staff
- Microsoft: Sincere condolences
- Samsung: Full-page newspaper ad

Even competitors acknowledging the loss.

## The Legend

Stories circulating:
- Perfectionism (reality distortion field)
- Simplicity obsession
- "One more thing"
- Brutal honesty
- Incredible comebacks

Not all positive, but all impactful.

## Stanford Students React

Overheard conversations:

"He dropped out of college and changed the world."
"Should we all drop out?"
"He also got fired from Apple."
"And came back stronger."

The entrepreneurial spirit amplified.

## Technical Legacy

In EE department, discussing his technical impact:
- Personal computing revolution
- Digital music transformation
- Smartphone era begun
- Tablet computing defined
- Ecosystem thinking

Not inventor, but perfector. Made technology human.

## The Products That Changed Everything

My generation's timeline:
- Apple II: Before my time, but started it all
- Macintosh: First computer with personality
- iMac: Computers could be beautiful
- iPod: 1,000 songs in pocket
- iPhone: Everything device
- iPad: Post-PC era

Each revolutionary in its way.

## Lessons for Engineers

What he taught us:
1. **Design matters** - Not just function
2. **Simplicity is hard** - But worth it
3. **Integration wins** - Hardware + software
4. **Details count** - Obsess over them
5. **Vision essential** - See what others don't

## The Startup Impact

Every Silicon Valley startup influenced:
- Product presentations mimicked
- "Design thinking" everywhere
- User experience prioritized
- "What would Steve do?"
- Black turtleneck sales increase

His shadow over everything.

## Research Lab Discussion

In lab meeting, advisor asks: "What can we learn?"

Responses:
- "Focus on impact, not papers"
- "Make technology accessible"
- "Perfect is enemy of good, except when it's not"
- "Marketing matters for research too"
- "Change the world sounds cliché until someone does"

## The Human Side

Behind the legend:
- Adopted child made good
- Cancer fighter
- Father and husband
- Buddhist influences
- Complicated person

Reminder: Heroes are human.

## My iPhone Moment

Looking at my iPhone 4. Remembering first iPhone launch:
- Lines around block
- "Internet in your pocket!"
- Pinch to zoom magic
- App Store revolution

This device changed everything. One person's vision.

## The Future Without Jobs

Questions everywhere:
- Can Apple continue?
- Who's the next visionary?
- Is the era ending?
- What would he build next?

No answers. Just uncertainty.

## A Personal Decision

His Stanford speech echoing:
"Don't settle."
"Follow your heart."
"Stay hungry."

Am I settling in PhD? Following my heart? Hungry enough?

Time for honest reflection.

## The Vigil

Evening at Apple Store Palo Alto. Hundreds gathered. Candles, flowers, iPads with "Thank You Steve" messages.

Strangers sharing stories:
- "First Mac changed my life"
- "iPhone helped me start my company"
- "iPad let my grandma video chat"

Technology as human connection.

## Media Coverage

Every outlet covering:
- CNN: Breaking news all day
- Tech blogs: Retrospectives
- International: Global mourning
- Social media: #ThankYouSteve trending

Rare unanimous appreciation.

## The Stanford Legacy

University response:
- Flags lowered
- Memorial planned
- Entrepreneurship programs expanded
- Innovation emphasized more

His spirit embedded here.

## One Week Later

Life continues but changed:
- Apple stock volatile
- Biography pre-orders soaring
- Documentary plans announced
- Everyone asking "what's next?"

But also:
- More students starting companies
- Design classes overflowing
- Risk-taking encouraged
- Dreams seem possible

## The Lesson

Steve Jobs showed us:
- Vision matters
- Execution crucial

- Life short

"Stay hungry. Stay foolish."

We will, Steve. We will.

Rest in peace. Thank you for the magic. 🍎
