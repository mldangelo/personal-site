The fall quarter is underway, and it's great to be back on the Stanford campus. There's a unique energy here at the beginning of the school year, a sense of new beginnings and limitless possibilities.

This year, my academic focus is on the more advanced topics in machine learning. I'm taking courses in probabilistic graphical models and convex optimization, which are the theoretical underpinnings of many of the algorithms I use every day at Planet.

It's a chance to move beyond the "what" and truly understand the "why." Why does a particular model work? What are its fundamental assumptions and limitations? Having this deeper theoretical knowledge is essential for anyone who wants to do novel work in the field.

It's also my last year to soak up the incredible intellectual environment of this place. I'm making a conscious effort to go to talks, to meet with professors, and to have those serendipitous conversations with classmates that so often lead to new ideas.

It's the beginning of the end of my time at Stanford, and I plan to make the most of it.
