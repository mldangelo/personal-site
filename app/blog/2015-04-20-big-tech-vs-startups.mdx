The past few weeks have been a blur of interviews, and I'm incredibly grateful to have received offers from a few amazing companies. The decision I'm facing now is a classic one that every engineer in Silicon Valley grapples with at some point: do I go to a big, established company or a small, scrappy startup?

On one hand, the big tech companies offer incredible scale. The opportunity to work on products that are used by billions of people is a powerful draw. They offer stability, amazing perks, and the chance to learn from some of the most experienced engineers in the world. It's a structured path for growth and a fantastic name on a resume.

On the other hand, startups offer ownership. The chance to be one of the first employees, to have a hand in shaping the product, the culture, and the destiny of the company is a unique and thrilling prospect. The work is often more varied, the pace is faster, and the potential for impact (and financial reward, if things go well) is uncapped. It's a high-risk, high-reward environment.

Both paths are compelling, and they optimize for different things. One offers a front-row seat to the operations of a global empire; the other offers a chance to build an empire from scratch. The next few days will be about deep reflection on what I truly want for the next chapter of my career.
