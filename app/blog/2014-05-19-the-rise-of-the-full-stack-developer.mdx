A look at the Hacker News hiring trends this month shows the term "full-stack developer" is on the rise. It's a term that can be controversial, but I think it points to a valuable and important trend.

In the early days of the web, it was common for a single person to be responsible for everything from the database to the CSS. As the industry matured, we saw a rise in specialization: front-end engineers, back-end engineers, database administrators, etc.

Now, the pendulum is swinging back. The rise of cloud computing, powerful frameworks, and DevOps culture has made it possible for a single engineer to have a much larger impact across the entire stack. A "full-stack" developer isn't necessarily an expert in everything, but they have a working knowledge of the entire system, from the user interface to the infrastructure.

This is the kind of engineer we're trying to cultivate at Planet. The lines between hardware and software, between front-end and back-end, are blurry. An engineer might be writing Python code for the satellite one day, and building a data visualization in JavaScript the next.

This generalist approach is a huge advantage in a startup environment. It allows for more flexibility, better communication, and a more holistic understanding of the product. It's not about knowing everything; it's about having the curiosity and the ability to learn quickly and solve problems wherever they may arise.
