  content: `The deep learning revolution is real. After struggling with shallow networks, I finally got a deep architecture working. The results are incredible.

## The Breakthrough

Geoffrey Hinton's recent papers on training deep networks changed everything:
- Layer-wise pre-training
- ReLU activation functions
- Dropout for regularization
- Better initialization

## My Implementation

Built a 5-layer network for MNIST:

\`\`\`python
import numpy as np

class DeepNeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self):
        self.layers = [
            784,  # Input (28x28 images)
            500,  # Hidden layer 1
            300,  # Hidden layer 2  
            100,  # Hidden layer 3
            10    # Output (10 digits)
        ]
        
        # Initialize weights with Xavier initialization
        self.weights = []
        for i in range(len(self.layers)-1):
            w = np.random.randn(self.layers[i], self.layers[i+1]) 
            w *= np.sqrt(2.0 / self.layers[i])
            self.weights.append(w)
    
    def relu(self, x):
        return np.maximum(0, x)
    
    def forward(self, X):
        self.activations = [X]
        
        for w in self.weights[:-1]:
            z = np.dot(self.activations[-1], w)
            a = self.relu(z)
            self.activations.append(a)
        
        # Output layer with softmax
        z = np.dot(self.activations[-1], self.weights[-1])
        exp_z = np.exp(z - np.max(z, axis=1, keepdims=True))
        softmax = exp_z / np.sum(exp_z, axis=1, keepdims=True)
        self.activations.append(softmax)
        
        return self.activations[-1]
\`\`\`

## Training with Backpropagation

The magic of automatic differentiation:

\`\`\`python
def backprop(self, X, y, learning_rate=0.01):
    m = X.shape[0]
    self.forward(X)
    
    # Backward pass
    delta = self.activations[-1] - y
    
    for i in range(len(self.weights)-1, -1, -1):
        self.weights[i] -= learning_rate *             np.dot(self.activations[i].T, delta) / m
        
        if i > 0:
            delta = np.dot(delta, self.weights[i].T)
            delta *= (self.activations[i] > 0)  # ReLU derivative
\`\`\`

## Results That Shocked Me

Compared to my old shallow network:
- Shallow (1 hidden layer): 96.5% accuracy
- Deep (3 hidden layers): 98.7% accuracy
- Training time: Similar!
- Features learned: Much more complex

## Visualizing Learned Features

The network learned hierarchical features:
- Layer 1: Edges and strokes
- Layer 2: Corners and curves
- Layer 3: Parts of digits
- Layer 4: Full digit templates

## GPU Acceleration Attempts

Tried CUDA programming:

\`\`\`cuda
__global__ void matrixMultiply(float* A, float* B, float* C, 
                               int N, int M, int K) {
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    
    if (row < N && col < K) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
            sum += A[row * M + i] * B[i * K + col];
        }
        C[row * K + col] = sum;
    }
}
\`\`\`

10x speedup on my GTX 480!

## The Bigger Picture

Deep learning changes everything:
- Computer vision: Near-human performance
- Speech recognition: Finally working
- Natural language: Getting better
- Game playing: Beating humans

## Next Steps

Building a convolutional neural network:
- Convolution layers for vision
- Pooling for translation invariance
- Even deeper architectures
- ImageNet challenge?
