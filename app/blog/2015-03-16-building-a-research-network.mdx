One of the most valuable parts of my time at Stanford has been the opportunity to build a network of brilliant and passionate researchers. As I get deeper into my thesis work, I'm constantly reminded that science is not a solitary pursuit.

The most exciting breakthroughs are happening at the boundaries between different disciplines. My own work, which combines satellite engineering, computer vision, and data science, is a perfect example of this.

To be successful, I need to be able to talk to experts in all of these fields. I need to be able to have a coherent conversation with an aerospace engineer about orbital mechanics, and then turn around and have an equally coherent conversation with a computer science professor about the latest in deep learning.

This is the power of a place like Stanford. It's a community of experts in a wide range of fields, and there's a culture of open collaboration that makes it easy to learn from people outside of your own discipline.

I'm making a conscious effort to build and nurture this network. I'm going to talks, I'm having coffee with people from different departments, and I'm sharing my own work and getting feedback from a diverse group of people. This collaborative spirit is the lifeblood of modern research, and it's something I'll carry with me long after I leave Stanford.
