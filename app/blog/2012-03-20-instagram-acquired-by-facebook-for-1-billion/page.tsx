  content: `The news just broke - Facebook is acquiring Instagram for $1 BILLION. A photo-sharing app with 13 employees and zero revenue. The Valley is in shock.

## The Numbers Don't Add Up

Let's break this down:
- 13 employees = $77M per employee
- 30 million users = $33 per user
- 0 revenue = Infinite revenue multiple
- 2 years old = $500M value created per year

## The Product

Instagram is brilliantly simple:
- Square photos (like Polaroids)
- Filters that make any photo look good
- Dead simple sharing
- Following/likes system
- iPhone only (Android coming)

## Why It's Genius

Having built photo apps, Instagram nailed it:

\`\`\`python
# What Instagram does
def share_photo(image):
    square_crop(image)
    apply_filter(image)  # This is the magic
    upload(image)
    notify_followers()
    
# What everyone else does
def share_photo(image):
    crop_ui()  # Complex
    adjust_settings()  # Overwhelming
    add_text()  # Unnecessary
    choose_privacy()  # Confusing
    # User gives up
\`\`\`

## The Technical Achievement

Built on:
- Python/Django backend
- PostgreSQL + Redis
- Amazon EC2
- CDN for images
- Extremely efficient architecture

Handling millions of photos with 13 people!

## The Timing

Why now?
- Mobile-first is the future
- Photo sharing is exploding
- Facebook's mobile is weak
- Competitive threat from Twitter

## Stanford Reaction

Everyone's talking about it:
- "Should have built a photo app"
- "My startup is worth millions!"
- "Bubble 2.0 is here"
- "No, this time it's different"

## The Founders' Story

Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger:
- Met at Stanford
- Rejected Facebook job offers
- Pivoted from Burbn (check-in app)
- Focused on one feature: photos

## Personal Reflection

Lessons for my startup ideas:
1. **Simplicity wins**: One feature done perfectly
2. **Timing matters**: Mobile wave lifting all boats
3. **Execution is everything**: Filters were the differentiator
4. **Growth trumps revenue**: Users first, monetization later

## The Future

What this means:
- Acquihires will get crazier
- Mobile-first is mandatory
- Social features in everything
- Photo apps will explode

Time to build that computer vision photo app idea...
