This month, I'll be heading to Logan, Utah, for the annual Small Satellite Conference. It's one of the most important events in our industry, and I'm incredibly honored (and a little nervous) to have been selected to give a talk.

My presentation will be about the software and data pipeline we've built at Planet. I'll be covering how we're using cloud infrastructure and agile development practices to manage the largest constellation of Earth-imaging satellites in history.

The process of preparing the talk has been a fantastic exercise in clarifying my own thinking. It's one thing to be deep in the weeds of a technical problem every day. It's another thing entirely to step back and explain that work to an audience of peers in a clear and compelling way.

I've been spending my evenings and weekends refining my slides, practicing my delivery, and trying to anticipate the questions I'll get from an audience of seasoned aerospace professionals.

Public speaking is a new skill for me, but it's one I'm excited to develop. It's a chance to share what we're building at Planet, to contribute to the broader conversation in our industry, and to represent the incredible work that our team is doing. Wish me luck!
