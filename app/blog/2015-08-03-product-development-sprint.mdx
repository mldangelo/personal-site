The past week has been a blur of focused, heads-down work. We've taken the wealth of feedback from our first customer conversations and translated it into a concrete product roadmap for the next few weeks. Now, it's all about execution.

We're running our first official development sprint. We've created a prioritized list of features and bug fixes, and the whole team is focused on getting them built, tested, and deployed as quickly as possible.

This is the engine room of a startup. It's where ideas and feedback are forged into code. The energy is a mix of intense focus and creative collaboration. We're constantly whiteboarding ideas, reviewing each other's code, and pushing each other to build the best possible product.

The goal is to get a new and improved version of our MVP back into the hands of our users as quickly as we can. We need to keep the feedback loop turning, to show our early adopters that we're listening, and to continue to learn and iterate our way to product-market fit. It's an exhausting but exhilarating process.
