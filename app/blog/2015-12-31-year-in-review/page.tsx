            <p>As 2015 comes to a close, it\'s time for my annual tradition of reflecting on the past year and setting intentions for the year ahead. This has been a year of learning and growth.</p>
            <h2>The Year in Summary</h2>
            <p><strong>Status</strong>: Stanford MS second year</p>
            <p>This year has been defined by transitioning from student to professional. Looking back at my goals from last year, I'm pleased with the progress.</p>
            <h2>Professional Growth</h2>
            <p>The transition from industry to graduate school has been intellectually stimulating. Working on ML research has shown me the cutting edge of technology.</p>
            <p>Major accomplishments:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Completed advanced ML coursework</li>
              <li>Built deep learning models from scratch</li>
              <li>Prepared to start my own company</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Technical Learning</h2>
            <p>This year's technical exploration focused on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>TensorFlow</strong>: Democratizing ML, but the API could be better</li>
              <li><strong>GPU programming</strong>: Game-changing technology that shaped my work this year</li>
              <li><strong>Container orchestration</strong>: Game-changing technology that shaped my work this year</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The most impactful learning was TensorFlow, which opened new possibilities for my projects.</p>
            <h2>Personal Interests & Hobbies</h2>
            <h3>Space & Astronomy</h3>
            <p>Space exploration continues to inspire: Pluto flyby, Water on Mars confirmed, SpaceX landing attempts. The Pluto flyby images were breathtaking - we are exploring the entire solar system.</p>
            <p>Still doing astrophotography when I can escape the Stanford workload. Iceland northern lights were a photographer dream.</p>
            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>Travel photography dominated this year with visits to Japan (Tokyo, Kyoto). Still shooting with my trusty Canon DSLR.</p>
            <p>Photography highlights:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Northern lights in Iceland</li>
              <li>Experimenting with long exposures</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Other Pursuits</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>trail running</strong>: Found peace in the mountains</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Travel & Experiences</h2>
            <p>Travel continues to be a source of inspiration and perspective:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Japan (Tokyo, Kyoto)</strong>: The perfect blend of future and tradition</li>
              <li><strong>Iceland northern lights</strong>: Photographing aurora while standing on a glacier</li>
              <li><strong>Burning Man</strong>: Memorable experiences and new perspectives</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each trip taught me something new about the world and myself.</p>
