The tech industry and the government are on a collision course over the issue of encryption. As companies like Apple and Google build stronger and stronger encryption into their products, law enforcement and intelligence agencies are arguing that they are "going dark" and losing the ability to track criminals and terrorists.

The latest reports suggest that the government is actively trying to find a way to force companies to build "backdoors" into their products, to give them a way to bypass the encryption.

This is a profoundly dangerous idea.

You cannot build a backdoor that only the "good guys" can use. A backdoor is a vulnerability, and any vulnerability will eventually be discovered and exploited by the "bad guys," whether they are criminals, hackers, or foreign governments.

By forcing companies to weaken the security of their products, the government would be making us all less safe. They would be creating a world where our most sensitive information—our private conversations, our financial data, our location history—is vulnerable to attack.

The tech industry needs to stand firm on this issue. We cannot and should not compromise the security of our users. Strong encryption is one of the most powerful tools we have to protect ourselves in the digital age. It's a tool we must defend.
