When most of us think of satellite imagery, we think of the beautiful, static mosaic of the world we see in Google Maps. It’s a snapshot, a fixed portrait of our planet. But what if it wasn’t a portrait? What if it was a movie?

This is the paradigm shift at the heart of Planet Labs, and it’s what I’ve been obsessing over since I started. By launching flocks of small, inexpensive satellites, we can image the entire landmass of the Earth *every single day*. The planet is no longer a static image; it’s a living, breathing system whose changes we can track in near-real-time.

This is a profound shift. It means creating a dataset that has never existed before. Suddenly, we can ask questions that were previously unanswerable. How quickly is that rainforest disappearing? What are the real-time effects of that drought on crop yields? Where are all the ships in the world right now? How is that city growing month over month?

This isn't just about taking pretty pictures. It's about providing a new utility for the planet. We're building a queryable database of the physical world, a tool for transparency and measurement that can empower governments, environmental groups, businesses, and scientists to make better decisions. The potential applications are endless, and the sense of purpose that comes from building something with such broad, positive potential is immense.
