After months of non-stop work, I took a short break this month to travel to Iceland with a single goal in mind: to see the aurora borealis. It's a phenomenon that has been on my bucket list for years, and the experience was more incredible than I could have ever imagined.

There's something truly magical about standing in the cold, dark night and watching the sky come alive with dancing curtains of green and purple light. It's a silent, ethereal light show that feels both ancient and alive.

As a photographer, it was a challenging and rewarding subject. Capturing the aurora requires a good camera, a sturdy tripod, and a lot of patience. But when you get the shot, it's a thrill to be able to capture a small piece of that magic.

More than anything, it was a humbling experience. In the world of technology, we often get caught up in our own creations. We can start to believe that the world is something that can be contained in a dataset or simulated in a computer.

To stand under the aurora is to be reminded of the immense and beautiful power of the natural world. It's a force that is far beyond our comprehension and our control. It's a powerful and necessary perspective check, and I'm returning to work with a renewed sense of wonder and a deep appreciation for the planet we get to call home.
