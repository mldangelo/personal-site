This week's Apple keynote was a masterclass in ambition. It wasn't just an incremental update; it was a clear statement about Apple's vision for the future of personal computing.

The larger iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were an expected but necessary move. Apple has finally answered the market's demand for larger screens, and they've done it with their typical polish and attention to detail.

But the real story is about the two new platforms they introduced.

Apple Pay is the most elegant and secure solution to mobile payments I've ever seen. By using NFC and a secure element, they've managed to create a system that is both incredibly simple for users and incredibly secure. If anyone can solve the chicken-and-egg problem of mobile payments, it's Apple. This has the potential to be truly disruptive.

And then there's the Apple Watch. It's a beautiful piece of hardware, and the software shows a deep understanding of the unique challenges of a wearable interface. The focus on "glances" and short interactions is smart. It's not trying to be a tiny phone on your wrist. It's a new kind of device, and it's Apple's first entry into a post-iPhone product category.

It's a bold and exciting vision. Apple isn't just building products; they're building ecosystems. And they've just planted the seeds for the next two.
