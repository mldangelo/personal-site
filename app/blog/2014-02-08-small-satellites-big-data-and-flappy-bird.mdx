It's impossible to ignore the Flappy Bird phenomenon that has swept the globe this week. It's a deceptively simple game, yet its virality is a powerful lesson in how small, simple things can achieve massive scale. It got me thinking about what we're doing at Planet.

On the surface, a satellite company and a viral mobile game couldn't be more different. But the underlying principles share some surprising DNA. Flappy Bird's success comes from its simplicity and accessibility. It's a single interaction, repeated.

Our Doves are, in their own way, the "Flappy Bird" of satellites. Compared to traditional, school-bus-sized satellites, our Doves are incredibly simple and small. We're not building one monolithic, perfect system. We're building hundreds of small, "good enough" systems that, together, create something far more powerful than the sum of their parts.

The data they produce is also simple in its essence: a pixel with a color value. But when you have billions of those pixels, covering the entire Earth every day, you create a dataset of unprecedented scale and value. You can detect patterns and changes that were invisible before.

Flappy Bird's creator, Dong Nguyen, pulled the game from app stores today, citing its addictive nature. It's a reminder that with great scale comes great responsibility. As we build our constellation, we're constantly thinking about the ethical implications of creating a dataset that can see the entire world. It's a challenge we take seriously as we scale our own simple idea to a global level.
