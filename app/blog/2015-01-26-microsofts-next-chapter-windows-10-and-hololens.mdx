For the past few years, it's felt like Microsoft has been playing catch-up. This week, they showed the world that they're ready to lead again. The announcements of Windows 10 and the HoloLens were a powerful statement of intent from a company that seems to have rediscovered its ambition.

Windows 10 is a smart and necessary move. A single, unified operating system that runs across phones, tablets, desktops, and the Xbox is a compelling vision. It's a course correction from the divisive Windows 8, and it's a platform that developers can get excited about.

But the real "one more thing" moment was the HoloLens. The demo of a self-contained, holographic computer was stunning. This isn't virtual reality, where you're closed off from the world. This is augmented reality, where digital information is seamlessly blended with your physical environment.

The demos of building 3D models, of a Skype call appearing on a wall, of playing Minecraft on a coffee tableâ€”it felt like science fiction. It was the kind of bold, long-term vision that we haven't seen from Microsoft in a long time.

There are still a million questions about the technology, the price, and the release date. But for the first time in a while, Microsoft has captured the imagination of the tech world. They've shown us a glimpse of a new kind of computing, and it's incredibly exciting.
