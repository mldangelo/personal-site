As I've gotten deeper into the world of academic research at Stanford, I've been struck by some of the inefficiencies and misaligned incentives in the system. The process of peer review can be slow and opaque. The pressure to publish can lead to a focus on quantity over quality. And it can be hard to gauge the true impact and reproducibility of a given piece of research.

This has led to a side project that a few friends and I have been brainstorming. We're calling it "Everitas," from the Latin word for "truth." The core idea is to create a platform that allows for a more dynamic and transparent assessment of academic work.

Imagine a system where papers are not just peer-reviewed once, but are subject to ongoing, public review and annotation by the scientific community. Imagine a system where researchers can build a reputation based not just on the number of papers they publish, but on the quality and reproducibility of their work. Imagine a system that can track the lineage of ideas and create a more accurate map of the landscape of a given field.

It's an ambitious idea, and right now, it's just a collection of notes and a few simple prototypes. But it's a problem that I'm passionate about. Science is one of the most important endeavors of humanity. And if we can build a system that helps it to function more effectively, that's a problem worth solving.
