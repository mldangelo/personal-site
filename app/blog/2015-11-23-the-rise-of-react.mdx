The world of JavaScript frameworks is a notoriously fast-moving one, but the ascent of React has been particularly stunning. According to the latest hiring data from Hacker News, React has officially surpassed AngularJS as the most mentioned front-end framework in job postings.

This is a significant milestone. For the past few years, Angular has been the undisputed king of the front-end world. It's a powerful and comprehensive framework that has been adopted by thousands of companies.

But React's component-based architecture, its focus on a one-way data flow, and its virtual DOM have clearly resonated with developers. It offers a more flexible and, for many, a more intuitive way to build complex user interfaces.

This is not to say that Angular is dead. Far from it. The Angular team is hard at work on Angular 2, which is a complete rewrite of the framework that incorporates many of the ideas that have made React so popular.

But for now, the momentum is clearly with React. It's a testament to the power of a good idea, and to the open-source community's ability to quickly adopt and embrace new and better ways of doing things. As we begin to build the front-end for Arthena, it's clear that a component-based architecture with React is the way to go.
