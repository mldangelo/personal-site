            <p>As 2010 comes to a close, it\'s time for my annual tradition of reflecting on the past year and setting intentions for the year ahead. This has been a year of learning and growth.</p>
            <h2>The Year in Summary</h2>
            <p><strong>Status</strong>: Sophomore, joined CubeSat program</p>
            <p>This year has been defined by academic growth and hands-on projects. Looking back at my goals from last year, I'm pleased with the progress.</p>
            <h2>Professional Growth</h2>
            <p>As a Sophomore, joined CubeSat program, I've been deeply immersed in satellite design. The CubeSat program has been transformative has taught me more than any classroom could.</p>
            <p>Key projects this year:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Designed power systems for our satellite</li>
              <li>Implemented MPPT algorithms</li>
              <li>Presented at regional conferences</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Technical Learning</h2>
            <p>This year's technical exploration focused on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Android development</strong>: Built my first app - a satellite tracker</li>
              <li><strong>FPGA programming</strong>: Parallel thinking is a different paradigm entirely</li>
              <li><strong>PCB design</strong>: Game-changing technology that shaped my work this year</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The most impactful learning was Android development, which opened new possibilities for my projects.</p>
            <h2>Personal Interests & Hobbies</h2>
            <h3>Space & Astronomy</h3>
            <p>This year was incredible for space exploration: SpaceX Falcon 9 first flight, Hayabusa returns from asteroid, Discovery of potentially habitable exoplanets. Working on our CubeSat while SpaceX achieved their first successes was inspiring.</p>
            <p>I've been learning astrophotography with my DSLR. Finally got a decent shot of Saturn through a borrowed telescope.</p>
            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>Photography remains my creative outlet. This year focused on landscape and night photography.</p>
            <p>Favorite shots from this year:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Star trails over the engineering building</li>
              <li>ISS transit across the moon</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Other Pursuits</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>robotics</strong>: Built a self-balancing robot that actually balances</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Travel & Experiences</h2>
            <p>Travel continues to be a source of inspiration and perspective:</p>

              <li><strong>NYC visits</strong>: The energy is infectious</li>
              <li><strong>Rochester tech meetups</strong>: Memorable experiences and new perspectives</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each trip taught me something new about the world and myself.</p>
