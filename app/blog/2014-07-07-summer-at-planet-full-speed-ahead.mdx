The summer has arrived, and with it, a welcome change of pace. After a year of juggling a full course load at Stanford with my work at Planet, I'm now able to dedicate my full attention to the company for the next few months.

The difference is palpable. The constant context-switching between academia and industry is gone, replaced by a singular focus on our mission. I can dive deep into a problem without having to worry about an upcoming exam or a problem set.

The energy in the office is at an all-time high. With Flock 1 fully operational and sending down terabytes of data, we're in a new phase of the company's life. The focus is shifting from just building and launching satellites to processing, analyzing, and delivering the data to our first customers.

It's an exciting time to be here. The team is growing, the challenges are getting more complex, and the sense of possibility is immense. This summer feels like a pivotal moment for the company, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it, full-time.
