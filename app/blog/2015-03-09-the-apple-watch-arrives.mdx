The wait is over. This week, Apple finally gave us all the details on the Apple Watch. We now know that it will be available in April, with prices ranging from $349 for the Sport model to over $10,000 for the solid gold Edition.

This is the most personal and ambitious product that Apple has ever created. It's a device that is meant to be worn on your body, to be a part of your personal style, and to be a constant companion.

The event showcased a wide range of use cases, from communication and fitness tracking to mobile payments and home automation. It's clear that Apple sees the Watch as a new platform, a new place for developers to build innovative and personal experiences.

The software is a masterclass in designing for a small screen. The "glances," the "taptic engine," and the "digital crown" are all novel solutions to the unique challenges of a wearable interface.

There are still a lot of open questions. Will the battery life be good enough? Will people be willing to spend this much on a first-generation device? Will it become a must-have accessory or a niche product?

Only time will tell. But one thing is clear: Apple is all in on wearables. They've created a beautiful, powerful, and deeply personal device, and in doing so, they've launched the next major computing platform.
