The tech world was caught by surprise this week with the news that Google is restructuring itself into a new parent company called Alphabet. It's a move that is both audacious and, in retrospect, perfectly logical.

Google has grown far beyond its origins as a search engine. It's a collection of ambitious and diverse businesses, from self-driving cars and smart thermostats to life extension research and drone delivery. The old corporate structure was becoming a bottleneck for these "moonshot" projects.

By creating Alphabet, Larry Page and Sergey Brin are giving these projects the autonomy and the focus they need to thrive. Each company under the Alphabet umbrella will have its own CEO and its own identity. The core Google business, which includes search, ads, and Android, will be run by the newly appointed CEO, Sundar Pichai.

This is a move that is designed for the long term. It's a way to keep the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit of Google alive as it matures into one of the largest and most powerful companies in the world. It's a bet on the power of focused, independent teams to solve the world's biggest problems.

As a founder, I find this move incredibly inspiring. It's a reminder that even the biggest companies need to be willing to reinvent themselves, and that the best way to foster innovation is to empower great people and then get out of their way.
