      summary="First research success at Stanford! Combined multiple energy sources to finally reach milliwatt harvesting. Advisor impressed. Maybe I belong here."
      content={`After months of frustration, finally had a breakthrough in the energy harvesting research. By combining multiple ambient sources and clever power management, we're consistently harvesting over 1 milliwatt. First time my advisor said "excellent work." Maybe this PhD thing will work out.

## The Problem Revisited

Been stuck for months:
- WiFi signals: ~100 μW max
- Vibrations: ~500 μW (if lucky)
- Indoor solar: ~200 μW/cm²
- Temperature gradients: ~50 μW

Each source alone: insufficient. But what if we combine them?

## The Insight

Walking across campus, noticed:
- Morning: Bright light, cool temperature
- Afternoon: Less light, warm surfaces
- Evening: No light, WiFi usage peaks
- Night: Temperature differentials, vibrations from HVAC

Different sources peak at different times!

## Multi-Source Architecture

Designed hybrid harvester:

\`\`\`
[Solar Cell] ─┐
[Thermoelectric] ─┼─→ [Power Combining] → [Storage] → [Load]
[Piezo Vibration] ─┤         Circuit
[RF Rectenna] ─┘
\`\`\`

Key: Don't just switch between sources. Combine them intelligently.

## Power Combining Circuit

The breakthrough - adaptive combination:

\`\`\`python
# Simplified model
def combine_sources(solar, thermal, vibration, rf):
    # Each source has different impedance
    # Direct connection would waste power
    
    # Solution: Individual MPPT per source
    solar_power = mppt_solar(solar)
    thermal_power = mppt_thermal(thermal)
    vibration_power = mppt_vibration(vibration)
    rf_power = mppt_rf(rf)
    
    # Combine at optimal voltage
    total = solar_power + thermal_power + vibration_power + rf_power
    
    return total * efficiency
\`\`\`

## Maximum Power Point Tracking

Each source needs different MPPT:

### Solar MPPT
\`\`\`c
float mppt_solar(float v_open, float i_short) {
    // Fractional open circuit voltage method
    float v_mpp = 0.76 * v_open;  // Typical for silicon
    
    // Perturb and observe
    if (power_now > power_last) {
        v_ref += delta_v;
    } else {
        v_ref -= delta_v;
    }
    
    return v_mpp * current_at_vmpp;
}
\`\`\`

### Vibration MPPT
\`\`\`c
float mppt_vibration(float freq, float amplitude) {
    // Match electrical and mechanical resonance
    float z_mechanical = calculate_mechanical_impedance(freq);
    float z_electrical = conjugate(z_mechanical);
    
    adjust_load_impedance(z_electrical);
    
    return extract_maximum_power();
}
\`\`\`

## Circuit Implementation

Built with discrete components:

### Ultra-Low Power Management
\`\`\`c
// Sub-threshold operation for control
void power_manager_init() {
    // Operate at 0.3V for minimal consumption
    set_voltage_subthreshold();
    
    // Cold start from any source
    enable_all_inputs();
    
    // Prioritize based on availability
    while (1) {
        measure_all_sources();
        configure_optimal_extraction();
        sleep_until_change();
    }
}
\`\`\`

Power manager itself uses only 500 nW!

## Measurement Results

Lab setup with controlled sources:

### Individual Sources
- Solar (100 lux): 180 μW
- Thermal (5°C gradient): 60 μW
- Vibration (HVAC): 200 μW
- RF (WiFi router 1m): 40 μW
- **Total (simple sum)**: 480 μW

### With Smart Combination
- Morning (solar peak): 850 μW
- Afternoon (thermal+vibration): 920 μW
- Evening (RF+vibration): 780 μW
- **24-hour average**: 1.1 mW!

## The Magic: Impedance Matching

Key insight - impedance transformation:

\`\`\`python
# Each source has wildly different impedance
solar_impedance = 1000  # ohms (high voltage, low current)
thermal_impedance = 10  # ohms (low voltage, high current)
vibration_impedance = 50000  # ohms (high Q resonator)
rf_impedance = 50  # ohms (antenna matched)

# Transform all to common voltage
# Use switched capacitor converters
# Minimal loss, no inductors
\`\`\`

## Real-World Deployment

Tested in various locations:

### Office Environment
- Under desk lamp: 1.3 mW average
- Near window: 1.8 mW average
- Conference room: 0.9 mW average

### Home Environment
- Kitchen (vibrations): 1.2 mW
- Living room: 0.8 mW
- Bedroom (quiet): 0.4 mW

Consistently above 1 mW target!

## Application: Wireless Sensor Node

Built demo with harvested power:

\`\`\`c
void sensor_node_operation() {
    // Accumulate energy
    while (energy_stored < threshold) {
        sleep_mode_extreme();  // 10 nA
    }
    
    // Burst operation
    wake_up();                 // 10 μA for 1 ms
    read_sensors();            // 1 mA for 10 ms  
    transmit_data();           // 20 mA for 5 ms
    
    // Total: 120 μJ per cycle
    // At 1 mW harvesting: 8 transmissions/second
}
\`\`\`

Perpetual operation achieved!

## Theoretical Analysis

Why combination works:

1. **Source Diversity**: Uncorrelated sources
2. **Time Diversity**: Different peak times
3. **Impedance Diversity**: Optimization opportunities
4. **Nonlinear Benefits**: MPPT gains compound

Imposter syndrome retreating (temporarily).

## Late Night Thought

2 AM in lab, harvester quietly generating power from fluorescent light buzz. This tiny board proves ambient energy isn't waste - it's opportunity.

We're surrounded by energy. Just needed right way to harvest it.

## Email from Mom

"I don't understand your research but I'm proud."

Sometimes that's all you need.

## Next Steps

- ISSCC reviews in December
- Patent application
- Journal version
- Industry collaboration
- Thesis chapter 1?

For now, celebrating small victory.
