The end of the fall quarter is in sight, and with it, the halfway point of my final year at Stanford. The past few months have been a whirlwind of advanced classes and challenging projects. Now, as things start to wind down for the holidays, my mind is turning to the future.

The question of "what's next?" is no longer a distant, abstract concept. It's a real and pressing one. I need to start making some decisions about where I want to be and what I want to be doing this time next year.

The options are both exciting and daunting. Do I continue on the path I'm on at Planet? Do I explore other opportunities in the industry? Do I reconsider the PhD route?

I'm planning to spend some time over the winter break doing some serious reflection and research. I want to talk to people in different roles, at different companies, and in different stages of their careers. I want to map out the possibilities and think deeply about what kind of impact I want to have.

It's a big decision, and I don't take it lightly. But it's also a privilege to have so many interesting paths to choose from.
