The closer I get to the end of my time at Stanford, the more my mind wanders into the world of new ideas. It's a familiar feeling for anyone who has been bitten by the entrepreneurial bug.

My time at Planet has been a masterclass in how to build a hard-tech company. I've seen firsthand what it takes to go from a bold idea to a fleet of satellites in orbit. It's been an invaluable experience, and I'm incredibly grateful for it.

But there's a unique and powerful allure to starting something from zero. It's the challenge of taking a blank sheet of paper and turning it into a product, a team, and a company. It's the thrill of building something that is entirely your own.

My notebooks are filling up with ideas, from new applications of machine learning to ways to improve the scientific research process itself. I'm spending my free time building small prototypes, talking to potential users, and exploring different markets.

I don't know yet if any of these ideas will turn into my next chapter. But the process of exploration is energizing. It's a reminder of the infinite number of problems that are waiting to be solved, and of the incredible power of a small team with a big idea.
