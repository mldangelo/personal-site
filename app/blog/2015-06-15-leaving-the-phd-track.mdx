For the past year, the question of whether or not to pursue a PhD has been a constant presence in my mind. It's the logical next step on the academic path, a path that I have always loved and respected. The opportunity to do fundamental research, to contribute to the sum of human knowledge, is a powerful and noble calling.

But there's another call that has been growing louder in my heart. It's the call of the builder, the entrepreneur. It's the desire to take an idea and turn it into a product, a team, and a company.

After countless hours of reflection, conversation, and soul-searching, I have made a choice. I am respectfully declining my PhD offers to start a new company with a few of my close friends.

This is, without a doubt, the hardest and scariest decision I have ever made. I am walking away from a safe, prestigious, and well-defined path to embrace a world of uncertainty and risk. I am trading the life of a scholar for the life of a founder.

There is no guarantee of success. In fact, the odds are stacked against us. But the idea we're pursuing is one that I am so passionate about, and the team we've assembled is one that I believe in so deeply, that the risk of not trying feels greater than the risk of failure.

It's a leap of faith into the unknown. And I've never been more excited.
