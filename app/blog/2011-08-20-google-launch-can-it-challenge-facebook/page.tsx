## First Impressions

The UI is clean, fast, and feels more "grown-up" than Facebook:
- Material design elements
- Generous whitespace
- Fast loading
- No ads (yet)

## Circles: Privacy Done Right

The Circles concept is brilliant. Finally, a social network that understands relationships have context:

- Family Circle: Parents, siblings
- Friends Circle: Close friends only
- Acquaintances: That guy from the conference
- Following: Public figures, tech leaders

Sharing is contextual - I can share party photos with friends without my boss seeing them.

## Hangouts: Video Chat That Works

Tried Hangouts with Stanford colleagues:
- Up to 10 people video chat
- Automatic speaker switching
- Screen sharing built-in
- No plugins required

This could replace Skype for group calls.

## The Stream

The feed (called Stream) feels cleaner than Facebook:
- No game invites
- Better formatting for long posts
- +1 instead of Like (subtle but different)
- Inline photo viewing

## Sparks: Interest-Based Discovery

Sparks aggregates content around interests:
- "Machine Learning" spark
- "Robotics" spark
- "Space Exploration" spark

Like RSS feeds but social.

## Early Adopter Paradise

Right now it's mostly tech people:
- Actual discussions in comments
- High-quality content
- No memes (yet)
- Real names policy

## Integration with Google Services

The ecosystem play is obvious:
- Gmail integration
- YouTube comments
- Google Docs sharing
- Android deep integration

## Will It Survive?

Challenges ahead:
- Facebook has 750 million users
- Network effects are strong
- Google's social track record (Wave, Buzz)
- Needs mainstream appeal

## My Take

Google+ is the best-designed social network yet. But being better might not be enough when everyone's already on Facebook.

Still, I'm moving my tech discussions here. The signal-to-noise ratio is incredible right now. Let's see if it lasts.
