My first full week at Planet Labs is in the books, and the experience has been nothing short of exhilarating. The term that keeps echoing in my mind is "agile aerospace." It sounds like a buzzword, but seeing it in practice is incredible.

Traditional aerospace operates on cycles measured in years, sometimes decades. The process is waterfall by necessity: design, build, test, and launch, with little room for error or iteration once the hardware is in orbit.

Planet is turning that model on its head. We're applying the rapid, iterative cycles of software development to building spacecraft. We build small, smart, and in large numbers. Our "Doves" are designed with commercial off-the-shelf components, which dramatically lowers the cost and development time. We launch them in flocks, constantly learning and improving with each new generation. A hardware bug isn't a mission-ending catastrophe; it's a lesson learned for the next flock, which might launch in a few months, not a few years.

This approach permeates the culture. The office feels more like a software startup than a space company. There are stand-up meetings, sprints, and a palpable sense of urgency and optimism. We're building satellites at a scale and speed that's unprecedented, and it feels like being on the ground floor of something truly revolutionary.
