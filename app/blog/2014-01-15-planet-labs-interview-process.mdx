I've been through my share of technical interviews, but the process at Planet Labs was in a different orbit. While Silicon Valley has largely standardized on algorithm challenges and system design questions, Planet's approach was a refreshing return to first-principles engineering.

Of course, there were rigorous software questions, but they were deeply contextualized. We didn't just talk about scaling a web service; we talked about scaling a data pipeline that ingests terabytes of image data from a constellation of satellites. We discussed algorithms for image processing, not just abstract data structures.

What really stood out was the breadth of the conversation. One moment we'd be discussing orbital mechanics and the next, the trade-offs of different sensor technologies. It was a holistic engineering discussion that spanned hardware, software, and the physics of space.

But more than anything, what struck me was the passion. Every single person I met was utterly captivated by the mission. They weren't just building a cool tech product; they were building a tool to help humanity understand and take care of its home planet. You can't fake that kind of energy. By the end of the day, they weren't just interviewing me; I was interviewing them, and I was completely sold on the vision.
