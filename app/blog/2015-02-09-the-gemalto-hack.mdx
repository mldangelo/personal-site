Just when you think the revelations from the Snowden documents couldn't get any more shocking, we learn that the NSA and its British counterpart, GCHQ, allegedly hacked into Gemalto, the world's largest manufacturer of SIM cards.

This is a breathtakingly audacious and deeply troubling operation. By stealing the encryption keys for millions of SIM cards, these agencies have given themselves the ability to decrypt a significant portion of the world's mobile communications.

This goes far beyond the targeted surveillance of suspected terrorists. This is a wholesale compromise of the global mobile communication infrastructure. It undermines the trust that we place in the fundamental technologies of our connected world.

It's also a reminder of the incredible asymmetry of modern cyber warfare. Even a multi-billion dollar company like Gemalto is no match for the resources and the capabilities of a nation-state attacker.

This is the world we live in now. A world where our governments are actively working to undermine the security of the technologies we rely on every day. It's a world that requires a renewed commitment to strong encryption, to user privacy, and to holding our own governments accountable.
