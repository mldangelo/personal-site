  content: `Just witnessed history on Kickstarter. The Pebble smartwatch raised over $10 MILLION, obliterating every crowdfunding record. I'm backer #38,421!

## The Product

Pebble is what we've been waiting for:
- E-paper display (readable in sunlight)
- 7-day battery life
- Waterproof
- Bluetooth to iPhone/Android
- Open SDK for apps

## Why I Backed It

As a hardware hacker, this is perfect:

\`\`\`c
// Potential Pebble app code
void handle_init() {
  window = window_create();
  text_layer = text_layer_create(GRect(0, 0, 144, 168));
  
  // Update time every minute
  tick_timer_service_subscribe(MINUTE_UNIT, handle_minute_tick);
  
  // Receive phone notifications
  bluetooth_connection_service_subscribe(bluetooth_handler);
}

void display_notification(char *message) {
  text_layer_set_text(text_layer, message);
  vibes_short_pulse();  // Haptic feedback
}
\`\`\`

## The Crowdfunding Revolution

Kickstarter changes everything:
- Direct to consumer
- No VC needed (initially)
- Community validation
- Marketing built-in

## The Numbers

Mind-blowing growth:
- Goal: $100,000

## Features That Excite Me

As a developer:
- Open platform
- Simple SDK
- App store coming
- Hardware specs published
- Bluetooth LE support

## My App Ideas

Already planning:
1. **Pomodoro Timer**: Productivity on wrist
2. **Bike Computer**: Speed, distance, cadence
3. **Smart Home Control**: Lights, temperature
4. **Conference Badge**: Dynamic name/info
5. **Bitcoin Ticker**: Real-time prices

## The Smartwatch Race

Everyone's jumping in:
- Apple: Rumored iWatch
- Google: Android Wear coming?
- Samsung: Already trying
- Sony: SmartWatch exists but meh

Pebble has first-mover advantage.

## Hardware Startup Lessons

What Pebble did right:
- Working prototype in video
- Clear use cases
- Developer-friendly
- Reasonable price ($115)
- Delivery timeline realistic

## Community Response

The comments are gold:
- "Shut up and take my money!"
- "Finally, a smartwatch that's actually smart"
- "Day 1 purchase for devs"
- "RIP regular watches"

## Personal Impact

This validates hardware startups:
- Consumers want innovative hardware
- Crowdfunding works for complex products
- Open platforms win
- Battery life still matters

September 2012 delivery can't come fast enough. Time to start coding watch apps!`,
