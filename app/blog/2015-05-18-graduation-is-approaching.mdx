The last major academic hurdle is behind me, and now, there's nothing left to do but wait for graduation. It's a strange and wonderful feeling. The stress of the past few months has been replaced by a sense of calm and a growing feeling of nostalgia.

I find myself walking around campus and seeing it in a new light. I'm appreciating the beauty of the architecture, the energy of the students, and the incredible intellectual atmosphere of this place.

It's a time of transition. I'm saying goodbye to the life of a student, with its familiar rhythms of classes, problem sets, and exams. I'm preparing to say goodbye to the friends who will be scattering to different parts of the country and the world.

There's a part of me that is sad to see this chapter of my life come to an end. My time at Stanford has been transformative, and I will always be grateful for the opportunities I've had here.

But there's also a palpable sense of excitement. The future is a blank canvas, and I'm looking forward to painting it. For now, I'm just trying to be present, to soak in these last few weeks, and to celebrate the end of an incredible journey.
