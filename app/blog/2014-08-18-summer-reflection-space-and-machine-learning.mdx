With the start of my final year at Stanford just around the corner, I've been taking some time to reflect on this incredible summer at Planet. The experience has solidified my belief that the intersection of space technology and machine learning is one of the most exciting frontiers in science and technology.

Space technology, and specifically the "NewSpace" movement, is solving the data acquisition problem. Companies like Planet are building the infrastructure to collect a vast, near-real-time dataset of our entire planet.

Machine learning, and specifically deep learning, is solving the data analysis problem. We're building the tools to process that massive dataset and extract meaningful insights from it.

When you put these two things together, you get a powerful feedback loop. The availability of a global, daily dataset will drive the development of new machine learning models. And the development of new models will unlock new applications and new value from that dataset.

We're moving from a world of data scarcity to a world of data abundance. The challenge is no longer just collecting the data; it's understanding it. This summer, I've had a front-row seat to the beginning of this revolution, and I'm convinced that the combination of space and ML will be a defining technological trend of the next decade.
