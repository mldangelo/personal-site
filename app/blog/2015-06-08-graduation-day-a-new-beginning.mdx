Today, I walked across the stage and received my diploma. It's a surreal and wonderful feeling to be officially done with my formal education. The pomp and circumstance of the graduation ceremony is a fitting end to a long and challenging journey.

As I sat there with my classmates, I couldn't help but reflect on the past two years. I came to Stanford with a desire to go deeper, to build a stronger theoretical foundation for my work. I'm leaving with so much more than that.

I'm leaving with a network of brilliant and lifelong friends. I'm leaving with a new way of thinking about problems. And I'm leaving with a deep sense of gratitude for the opportunity to have been a part of this incredible community.

I'm grateful to my professors, who challenged me and inspired me. I'm grateful to my colleagues at Planet, who supported me and gave me a real-world laboratory for the ideas I was learning in the classroom. And most of all, I'm grateful to my family, who have been my rock through it all.

Today is the end of a chapter, but it's also the beginning of a new one. The future is unwritten, and I'm excited to see what it holds.
