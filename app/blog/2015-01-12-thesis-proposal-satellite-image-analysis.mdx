This week, I took a big step towards graduation: I submitted my official Master's thesis proposal. The title is "Deep Learning for Large-Scale Satellite Image Analysis," and it's a topic that I'm incredibly passionate about.

The core of my research will be to explore how the latest techniques in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks, can be applied to the unique challenges of satellite imagery. I'll be working with the dataset from Planet, which gives me an unprecedented opportunity to work with global, high-frequency imagery.

My research will focus on a few key areas:

1.  **Land-Use Classification:** Can I train a model to accurately classify different types of land use (e.g., urban, agricultural, forest, water) at a global scale?
2.  **Change Detection:** Can I develop a system that can automatically detect significant changes, like deforestation or new construction, by comparing images over time?
3.  **Feature Extraction:** Can I build a model that can identify and map specific features, like roads or buildings, from our imagery?

This project is the perfect culmination of my time at Stanford. It combines the theoretical knowledge from my coursework with the practical, real-world challenges I've been working on at Planet. It's an ambitious project for a Master's thesis, but I'm excited to dive in and see what's possible.
