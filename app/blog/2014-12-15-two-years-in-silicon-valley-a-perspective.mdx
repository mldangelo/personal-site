It's hard to believe that I've been living in the Bay Area for more than two years. In some ways, it feels like I just arrived. In other ways, it feels like a lifetime.

This place has a unique and powerful gravity. It's a magnet for people who want to build the future, and that creates an atmosphere of intense energy and optimism. The ambient level of conversation is about new ideas, new technologies, and new companies. It's a place where the default assumption is that anything is possible.

It's also a place of incredible focus. The work ethic is intense, and the pressure to succeed is immense. It's a culture that is constantly looking forward, sometimes at the expense of the present.

Living here has been an education in itself. I've learned more about technology, business, and building things in the past two years than I could have imagined. I've had the privilege of working at two incredible companies and studying at one of the best universities in the world.

It's a place that can be both exhilarating and exhausting. But there's nowhere else I'd rather be right now. The future is being built here, and it's an incredible privilege to have a front-row seat.
