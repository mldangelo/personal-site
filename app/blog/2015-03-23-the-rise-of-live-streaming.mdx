There's a new front in the social media wars, and it's all about live video. The launch of Meerkat a few weeks ago, followed by Twitter's acquisition and launch of Periscope this week, has kicked off a frenzy of interest in mobile live-streaming.

The concept is simple but profound: with the tap of a button, you can broadcast what you're seeing and hearing to a global audience. It's a raw, unedited, and immediate form of communication.

This has the potential to be a transformative technology. It's a powerful tool for citizen journalism, allowing people to broadcast events as they happen, from protests to natural disasters. It's a new way for artists and celebrities to connect with their fans. And it's a new way for all of us to share our lives and our experiences in real-time.

Of course, there are also a host of new challenges. The potential for abuse, the questions of copyright, and the ephemeral nature of the content are all things that we'll have to grapple with as a society.

But one thing is clear: a new medium is being born. The combination of powerful smartphones, fast mobile networks, and a global social graph has made this possible. The world is about to become a much more transparent and interesting place.
