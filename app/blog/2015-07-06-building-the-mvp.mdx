Starting a new company is a journey into the unknown, and the first step is to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The goal of the MVP is not to build a perfect, polished product. It's to build the simplest possible version of your product that can deliver value to your first users and allow you to start learning.

This phase of a startup is often defined by Paul Graham's famous advice: "Do things that don't scale." We're not worried about building a system that can handle a million users. We're worried about building a system that can delight one user.

This means we're taking shortcuts. We're writing code that we know we'll have to throw away later. We're doing things manually that we'll eventually have to automate. We're focused on speed of iteration and learning, not on building a perfect, scalable architecture.

It's a different way of thinking for an engineer. You have to fight the instinct to over-engineer, to build for the future. You have to be ruthless about cutting scope and focusing on the one or two features that truly matter.

It's a messy, chaotic, and incredibly exciting phase. We're laying the foundation for our vision, one unscalable, handcrafted piece at a time.
