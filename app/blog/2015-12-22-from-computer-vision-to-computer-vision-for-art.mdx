For the past few years, my work in computer vision has been focused on the general problem of understanding the physical world from images. Now, with Arthena, I'm diving deep into a very specific and fascinating sub-field: computer vision for art.

This is a whole new set of challenges. The goal is no longer just to identify objects in an image; it's to understand more subtle and subjective qualities, like style, genre, and even aesthetic value.

The questions we're asking are different. Can we train a model to distinguish between a Picasso and a Monet? Can we build a system that can identify the influences of one artist on another? Can we use computer vision to help authenticate a piece of art?

This requires a different approach to building our models. We're not just training on massive datasets of everyday objects. We're curating our own datasets of fine art, and we're thinking about how to capture the unique visual language of the art world.

It's a field that is still in its infancy, and there are very few people working on it. That's what makes it so exciting. We're not just applying existing techniques; we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible. We're at the intersection of two of my greatest passions, and it's an incredible place to be.
