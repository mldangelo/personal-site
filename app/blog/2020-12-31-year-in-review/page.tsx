            <p>As 2020 comes to a close, it\'s time for my annual tradition of reflecting on the past year and setting intentions for the year ahead. This has been a year of transformation and impact.</p>
            <h2>The Year in Summary</h2>
            <p><strong>Status</strong>: Joined SmileID, pandemic</p>
            <p>This year has been defined by leadership and scale. Looking back at my goals from last year, I'm humbled by how much I still have to learn.</p>
            <h2>Professional Growth</h2>
            <p>Leading engineering at SmileID through a global pandemic has been the challenge of a lifetime.</p>
            <p>This year's highlights:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Scaled team from 6 to 15</li>
              <li>Mastered distributed systems and ML at scale</li>
              <li>Developed leaders across continents</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Technical Learning</h2>
            <p>This year's technical exploration focused on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Remote work tools</strong>: Game-changing technology that shaped my work this year</li>
              <li><strong>Zoom fatigue</strong>: Game-changing technology that shaped my work this year</li>
              <li><strong>ML ops</strong>: Game-changing technology that shaped my work this year</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The most impactful learning was Remote work tools, which transformed how I approach problems.</p>
            <h2>Personal Interests & Hobbies</h2>
            <h3>Space & Astronomy</h3>
            <p>Even as my career has moved away from space, I remain fascinated: SpaceX Crew Dragon, Mars 2020 launch, Starlink constellation grows. Private space stations are becoming reality.</p>
            <p>Less time for astrophotography these days, but lockdown actually provided some unexpected stargazing opportunities. The Jupiter-Saturn conjunction was spectacular.</p>
            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>Photography in the pandemic meant finding beauty locally.</p>
            <p>This year's focus:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Macro photography in the backyard</li>
              <li>Virtual photo walks with friends</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Other Pursuits</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>cycling</strong>: Bike commuting changed my perspective on cities</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Travel & Experiences</h2>
            <p>Well, this was the year travel plans went out the window. But even in lockdown, I found adventures:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Nowhere (pandemic)</strong>: Discovered hiking trails I had driven past for years</li>
              <li><strong>Local Bay Area exploration</strong>: Memorable experiences and new perspectives</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Even limited travel reminded me of the importance of exploration.</p>
            <h2>Predictions for 2021</h2>
