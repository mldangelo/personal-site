Company culture is one of those intangible things that's hard to define but easy to feel. The culture at Planet is one of the most unique and powerful I've ever been a part of.

It's a true melting pot of talent. In a single meeting, you'll have a veteran aerospace engineer who has worked on NASA missions, a PhD in remote sensing, and a self-taught software engineer who is an expert in cloud infrastructure. This diversity of experience is our secret weapon.

What unites everyone is the mission. The goal of imaging the entire Earth every day is so ambitious and so clearly beneficial that it galvanizes the entire team. There are no big egos; the mission is the star of the show.

This leads to a culture of intense collaboration and mutual respect. The software engineers have a deep appreciation for the challenges of hardware, and the hardware engineers are amazed by the scale of the data pipeline. Everyone is learning from everyone else.

It's a place where people are encouraged to be curious, to ask "why," and to challenge assumptions. It's a culture that's built for the long haul, and it's the foundation upon which we're building our constellation.
