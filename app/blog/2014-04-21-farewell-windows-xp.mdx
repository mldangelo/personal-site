It's official: after 12 years, Microsoft has finally ended support for Windows XP. It's a strange feeling. For me, and for millions of others, Windows XP wasn't just an operating system; it was the operating system for the better part of our formative years. The green start button, the blue taskbar, the rolling green hills of the default wallpaperâ€”it's all deeply ingrained in my memory.

It's easy for those of us in the Silicon Valley bubble to forget that the rest of the world doesn't upgrade on an annual cycle. The fact that, even today, a significant percentage of the world's computers are still running XP is a powerful lesson in the inertia of technology. For large organizations, the cost and complexity of upgrading can be immense.

The end of XP support is a security nightmare for those who can't or won't upgrade, but it's also a necessary step forward. It's a reminder that progress requires leaving the past behind, even when it's a comfortable and familiar past.

So here's to Windows XP. It was the stable, reliable workhorse that powered a generation of computing. It had its flaws, but it was also the backdrop for countless hours of learning, creating, and connecting. Farewell, old friend.
