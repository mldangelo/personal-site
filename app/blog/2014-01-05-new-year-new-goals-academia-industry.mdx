Happy New Year from Palo Alto! The first quarter of my Master's program at Stanford has been a whirlwind. After a fantastic summer at Facebook, diving deep into the world of large-scale software, it's been an interesting and rewarding shift to be back in an academic environment, surrounded by people who are pushing the theoretical boundaries of what's possible.

As I look ahead to 2014, my goals are split between two worlds that I'm incredibly excited to bring together.

First, there's the academic track. The Computational & Mathematical Engineering (CME) program is already stretching my mind in the best ways possible. My main goal here is to go deep, especially in machine learning and numerical optimization. I want to absorb the foundational knowledge that you can only get in a place like this, where the person who wrote the textbook might be teaching your class.

Second, and this is the big news, I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be joining Planet Labs this month. In many ways, this feels like coming home. After focusing on software, Planet is the perfect fusion of my undergraduate work in electrical engineering and the large-scale data problems I love. The mission is audacious: image the entire Earth, every single day. It's a return to satellites and hardware, but with the added challenge of a massive software and data pipeline. Itâ€™s the evolution of the work we started with the CubeSat program back at UB, but on a global, commercial scale.

The real challenge, and the biggest opportunity, will be weaving these two threads together. I'm hoping the practical, high-stakes problems at Planet will provide a concrete context for my studies at Stanford, while the theoretical rigor of my coursework will give me a stronger foundation to tackle the engineering challenges of "agile aerospace."

It's going to be a packed year, balancing demanding coursework with helping to build a constellation of satellites. But I've never been more excited. Here's to a busy and formative 2014.
