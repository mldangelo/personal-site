One of the most common conversations I have with my classmates these days is about the future. With graduation less than a year away, we're all facing the classic fork in the road: do we continue on the academic path and pursue a PhD, or do we take our skills and apply them in the industry?

There are compelling arguments for both sides.

A PhD offers the chance to go incredibly deep on a single topic, to become a true world expert, and to push the boundaries of human knowledge. It's an opportunity to do fundamental research and to have a lasting impact on a field. The intellectual freedom of academia is a powerful draw.

On the other hand, the industry offers a different kind of impact. At a company like Planet, I can work on problems at a scale and speed that are impossible in a university lab. I can be part of a team that's building and shipping a product that has an immediate, real-world impact. The feedback loop is faster, and the resources are often greater.

For me, the decision is particularly tough. I love the rigor and the intellectual curiosity of academia, but I'm also addicted to the energy and the sense of mission that comes from being part of a startup.

I don't have an answer yet, but it's a good problem to have. The fact that both paths are so appealing is a testament to the exciting time we're living in, where the lines between research and product are becoming increasingly blurred.
