title: "Why Art Needs Tech: A New Thesis"

summary: "My fascination with the art market has solidified into a new thesis: the art world is one of the last major markets to be transformed by technology, and there is a massive opportunity to build a more transparent, accessible, and data-driven ecosystem."

The more I learn about the art world, the more convinced I become that it is an industry on the cusp of a major technological transformation. It's a multi-billion dollar market that still operates on a foundation of opacity, personal relationships, and gut instinct.

In a world where every other major asset class, from stocks to real estate, has been revolutionized by data and technology, the art market remains an outlier. It's a world where information is siloed, where prices are subjective, and where access is limited to a small circle of insiders.

This is a huge opportunity.

We can use technology to bring transparency to this market. We can aggregate and analyze decades of auction data to build more objective valuation models. We can create platforms that make it easier for collectors to discover new artists and for artists to reach a global audience.

We can also build a new and more accessible model for art investment. For too long, blue-chip art has been an asset class that is only available to the ultra-wealthy. We can use technology to fractionalize ownership and to create new vehicles for people to invest in art.

This is the thesis that is driving my new obsession. It's a belief that by combining a deep appreciation for art with a rigorous, data-driven approach, we can build a better, fairer, and more beautiful art market for everyone.
