The past few years have seen a revolution in the field of computer vision. Thanks to the rise of deep learning, we can now build models that can "see" and understand the world in ways that were science fiction just a decade ago.

But right now, this powerful technology is only accessible to a small handful of experts at large tech companies and academic labs. If you want to build a custom computer vision model, you need a deep understanding of machine learning, a team of PhDs, and a whole lot of computing power.

We want to change that.

Today, I'm thrilled to announce the beginning of our new company, **Matroid**. Our mission is simple: to make computer vision easy. We're building a platform that will allow anyone, regardless of their technical background, to build and deploy a custom computer vision model.

Want to build a detector for your specific brand of product? Want to monitor a video feed for a particular event? With Matroid, you'll be able to do that in a matter of minutes, not months.

We believe that computer vision is a foundational technology, like the database or the internet, that will unlock a new wave of innovation. By putting this power into the hands of more people, we can't even imagine the amazing things they will build.

The journey starts today. We're a small team with a big vision, and we're excited to get to work.
