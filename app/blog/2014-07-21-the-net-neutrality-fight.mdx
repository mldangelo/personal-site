The ongoing debate about the future of net neutrality is something I'm following closely this summer. The proposal by the FCC to allow for internet "fast lanes" is a deeply troubling development, and it strikes at the heart of what has made the internet such a powerful engine for innovation.

The magic of the internet has always been its level playing field. When I was first starting out, I could create a website and have it be just as accessible as a site from a multi-billion dollar corporation. My packets were treated the same as their packets.

This principle is the foundation upon which the entire modern tech ecosystem is built. It allows a small startup with a great idea to compete with an entrenched incumbent. It ensures that the best ideas, not the deepest pockets, are the ones that win.

Allowing ISPs to create a two-tiered internet, where companies can pay for preferential treatment, would destroy this level playing field. It would stifle innovation, harm small businesses, and ultimately lead to a less vibrant and diverse internet.

At Planet, we rely on a fast and open internet to deliver our massive datasets to our customers. But more importantly, we are a company that was born out of the open, permissionless culture of the internet. It's a fight we all have a stake in, and it's one we can't afford to lose.
