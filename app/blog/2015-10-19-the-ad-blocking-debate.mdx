The debate over ad blocking has reached a fever pitch. Publishers are worried about their revenue, and tech companies are grappling with the ethics of a tool that strikes at the heart of the web's business model.

But the conversation is too often focused on the ad blockers themselves, and not on the underlying disease that they are a cure for. Ad blockers are not the problem; they are a symptom of a broken system.

For years, the online advertising industry has been engaged in a race to the bottom. They've given us pop-up ads, auto-playing videos, and invasive trackers that follow us around the web. They've slowed down our browsers, consumed our mobile data, and, in some cases, even served us malware.

Ad blockers are simply a rational response to this user-hostile environment. They are a tool that gives users a way to take back control of their own experience.

The solution is not to block the ad blockers. The solution is for the advertising and publishing industries to build a better system. We need a new model for online advertising that is respectful of users, that is not intrusive, and that provides real value.

We need ads that are faster, safer, and more relevant. We need a system that is built on a foundation of trust and transparency, not on a foundation of tracking and surveillance. Until we have that, ad blockers are here to stay.
