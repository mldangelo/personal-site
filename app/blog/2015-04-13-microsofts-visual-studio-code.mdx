If you had told me a few years ago that my new favorite code editor would be made by Microsoft, I would have been skeptical. But this week, the company released Visual Studio Code, and it's a truly impressive piece of software.

VS Code is a lightweight, fast, and free code editor that runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It has great support for a wide range of languages, and it comes with features like IntelliSense code completion and built-in debugging that were previously only available in the full Visual Studio IDE.

This is a significant and welcome move from Microsoft. It's a recognition that the developer world is no longer Windows-centric. It's a gift to the open-source community, and it's a smart strategic move to win the hearts and minds of developers who may have written Microsoft off.

Along with their moves to open-source parts of the .NET framework and their embrace of Linux on Azure, this is another sign of a "New Microsoft" under the leadership of Satya Nadella. It's a company that seems to be more open, more collaborative, and more in tune with the needs of the modern developer.

I've been using VS Code for the past few days, and I'm incredibly impressed. It's a beautiful, well-designed, and powerful tool, and it's a fantastic addition to the developer's toolkit.
