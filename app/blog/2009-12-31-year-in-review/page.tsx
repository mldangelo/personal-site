            <p>As 2009 comes to a close, it\'s time for my annual tradition of reflecting on the past year and setting intentions for the year ahead. This has been a year of learning and growth.</p>
            <h2>The Year in Summary</h2>
            <p><strong>Status</strong>: Freshman at UB</p>
            <p>This year has been defined by academic growth and hands-on projects. Looking back at my goals from last year, I'm pleased with the progress.</p>
            <h2>Professional Growth</h2>
            <p>As a Freshman at UB, I've been deeply immersed in astronomy. The preparation for industry has taught me more than any classroom could.</p>
            <p>Key projects this year:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Built my first microcontroller projects</li>
              <li>Learned PCB design fundamentals</li>
              <li>Started contributing to Arduino forums</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Technical Learning</h2>
            <p>This year's technical exploration focused on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Arduino</strong>: Started with blinking LEDs, ended with complex sensor networks</li>
              <li><strong>Linux</strong>: Finally comfortable with the command line - goodbye Windows</li>
              <li><strong>embedded systems</strong>: Understanding interrupts and DMA changed how I think about code</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The most impactful learning was Arduino, which opened new possibilities for my projects.</p>
            <h2>Personal Interests & Hobbies</h2>
            <h3>Space & Astronomy</h3>
            <p>This year was incredible for space exploration: 40th anniversary of Apollo 11, Kepler space telescope launch, ISS fully crewed. The 40th anniversary of Apollo 11 reminded me why I got into engineering.</p>
            <p>I've been learning astrophotography with my DSLR. My first Milky Way photo was terrible but magical.</p>
            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>Photography remains my creative outlet. This year focused on learning the basics - composition, exposure triangle.</p>
            <p>Favorite shots from this year:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Lightning strike over Lake Erie during a summer storm</li>
              <li>First successful Milky Way capture</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Other Pursuits</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>electronics</strong>: New hobby that brought balance to life</li>
              <li><strong>photography</strong>: New hobby that brought balance to life</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Travel & Experiences</h2>
            <p>Travel continues to be a source of inspiration and perspective:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Niagara Falls trips</strong>: Still awe-inspiring every time</li>
              <li><strong>Buffalo exploration</strong>: Memorable experiences and new perspectives</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each trip taught me something new about the world and myself.</p>
