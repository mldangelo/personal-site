            <p>As 2016 comes to a close, it\'s time for my annual tradition of reflecting on the past year and setting intentions for the year ahead. This has been a year of building and scaling.</p>
            <h2>The Year in Summary</h2>
            <p><strong>Status</strong>: Started Arthena</p>
            <p>This year has been defined by entrepreneurial challenges. Looking back at my goals from last year, I'm pleased with the progress.</p>
            <h2>Professional Growth</h2>
            <p>Leading Arthena through rapid growth has been the challenge of a lifetime.</p>
            <p>This year's highlights:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Grew from idea to product</li>
              <li>Learned about art markets and quantitative finance</li>
              <li>Built an incredible team and culture</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Technical Learning</h2>
            <p>This year's technical exploration focused on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>React Native</strong>: Game-changing technology that shaped my work this year</li>
              <li><strong>Blockchain exploration</strong>: Game-changing technology that shaped my work this year</li>
              <li><strong>Recommendation systems</strong>: Game-changing technology that shaped my work this year</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The most impactful learning was React Native, which transformed how I approach problems.</p>
            <h2>Personal Interests & Hobbies</h2>
            <h3>Space & Astronomy</h3>
            <p>Even as my career has moved away from space, I remain fascinated: Gravitational waves detected, Juno arrives at Jupiter, SpaceX first landing. The commercialization of space is accelerating faster than I predicted.</p>
            <p>Less time for astrophotography these days, but I still catch major events. Every clear night is a reminder to look up.</p>
            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>Travel photography dominated this year with visits to Art Basel. Switched to mirrorless for the weight savings.</p>
            <p>Photography highlights:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Documenting art for Arthena taught me studio photography</li>
              <li>Started selling prints for charity</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Other Pursuits</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>wine</strong>: Discovered natural wines and never looked back</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Travel & Experiences</h2>
            <p>Travel continues to be a source of inspiration and perspective:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Art Basel</strong>: Where art meets commerce meets party</li>
              <li><strong>Venice Biennale</strong>: Memorable experiences and new perspectives</li>
              <li><strong>London galleries</strong>: Memorable experiences and new perspectives</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each trip taught me something new about the world and myself.</p>
            <h2>Predictions for 2017</h2>
