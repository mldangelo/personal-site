            <p>As 2012 comes to a close, it\'s time for my annual tradition of reflecting on the past year and setting intentions for the year ahead. This has been a year of learning and growth.</p>
            <h2>The Year in Summary</h2>
            <p><strong>Status</strong>: Senior year, interviewing</p>
            <p>This year has been defined by academic growth and hands-on projects. Looking back at my goals from last year, I'm pleased with the progress.</p>
            <h2>Professional Growth</h2>
            <p>As a Senior year, interviewing, I've been deeply immersed in startups. The preparation for industry has taught me more than any classroom could.</p>
            <p>Key projects this year:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Completed senior design project</li>
              <li>Interviewed at top tech companies</li>
              <li>Graduated summa cum laude</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Technical Learning</h2>
            <p>This year's technical exploration focused on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Node.js</strong>: JavaScript on the server still feels weird but powerful</li>
              <li><strong>JavaScript frameworks</strong>: Game-changing technology that shaped my work this year</li>
              <li><strong>Cloud computing</strong>: Game-changing technology that shaped my work this year</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Personal Interests & Hobbies</h2>
            <h3>Space & Astronomy</h3>
            <p>This year was incredible for space exploration: Curiosity lands on Mars, SpaceX Dragon to ISS, Transit of Venus. Curiosity landing on Mars while we work on our own spacecraft is surreal.</p>
            <p>I've been capturing star trails and ISS passes. Photographed the transit of Venus - once in a lifetime event.</p>
            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>Photography remains my creative outlet. This year focused on creating a portfolio for the next chapter.</p>
