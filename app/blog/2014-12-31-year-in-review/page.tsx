            <p>As 2014 comes to a close, it\'s time for my annual tradition of reflecting on the past year and setting intentions for the year ahead. This has been a year of learning and growth.</p>
            <h2>The Year in Summary</h2>
            <p><strong>Status</strong>: Started Stanford MS, Planet Labs</p>
            <p>This year has been defined by transitioning from student to professional. Looking back at my goals from last year, I'm pleased with the progress.</p>
            <h2>Professional Growth</h2>
            <p>The transition from industry to graduate school has been intellectually stimulating. Working on machine learning has shown me the cutting edge of technology.</p>
            <p>Major accomplishments:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Started MS at Stanford</li>
              <li>Worked on real satellites at Planet</li>
              <li>Found the intersection of space and ML</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Technical Learning</h2>
            <p>This year's technical exploration focused on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Deep learning</strong>: The math is beautiful when you understand it</li>
              <li><strong>Computer vision</strong>: Game-changing technology that shaped my work this year</li>
              <li><strong>Distributed systems</strong>: Game-changing technology that shaped my work this year</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The most impactful learning was Deep learning, which opened new possibilities for my projects.</p>
            <h2>Personal Interests & Hobbies</h2>
            <h3>Space & Astronomy</h3>
            <p>Space exploration continues to inspire: Rosetta arrives at comet, Orion test flight, Planet Labs Flock-1 launch. Working at Planet Labs puts me directly in the NewSpace movement.</p>
            <p>Still doing astrophotography when I can escape the Stanford workload. The Perseid meteor shower from Yosemite was unforgettable.</p>
            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>Travel photography dominated this year with visits to Patagonia trek. Still shooting with my trusty Canon DSLR.</p>
            <p>Photography highlights:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Patagonian landscapes pushed my skills</li>
              <li>Experimenting with long exposures</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Other Pursuits</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>cycling</strong>: Bike commuting changed my perspective on cities</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Travel & Experiences</h2>
