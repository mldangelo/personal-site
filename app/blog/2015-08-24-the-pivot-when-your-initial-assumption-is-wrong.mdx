One of the most celebrated concepts in the lean startup methodology is the "pivot." It's the idea that you should be willing to make a fundamental change in your strategy when you realize that your initial assumptions were wrong. It's a concept that is easy to understand in theory, but incredibly difficult to face in practice.

We're at that point now with Matroid.

We started with the belief that there was a huge market for a simple, easy-to-use tool for building custom computer vision models. We've spent the past few months building our MVP and talking to potential customers. And the feedback has been consistent and clear: while the technology is impressive, it's not solving a burning, urgent problem for the people we've been talking to.

This is a tough pill to swallow. It's a moment of crisis for any startup. You've invested your time, your energy, and your heart into an idea, and the market is telling you that you were wrong.

Now, we have to make a hard choice. Do we persevere, hoping that we just haven't found the right customers yet? Or do we pivot, and use our technology to solve a different, more pressing problem?

The next few weeks will be a period of intense debate, soul-searching, and customer discovery. We need to be honest with ourselves, to let go of our ego, and to follow the evidence. A pivot is not an admission of failure; it's an act of survival. And it might be the only thing that saves our company.
