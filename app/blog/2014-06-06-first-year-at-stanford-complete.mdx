The last final exam is submitted, and just like that, my first year at Stanford is in the books. It's hard to believe how much has happened since I arrived last fall. The year has been a whirlwind of rigorous classes, late-night study sessions, and mind-expanding conversations.

Coming back to academia after a stint in industry was a transition, but it's been everything I hoped for. The opportunity to dive deep into the mathematical foundations of machine learning and computational engineering has given me a much more robust framework for thinking about the hard problems we're tackling at Planet.

The highlight has undoubtedly been the people. The professors are leaders in their fields, and the other students are some of the most brilliant and driven people I've ever met. Every conversation is an opportunity to learn something new.

Balancing the demands of a full-time Master's program with a full-time job at a startup has been a monumental challenge. It's pushed my limits in terms of time management and focus. But the synergy between the two has been incredible. The theoretical knowledge from Stanford and the practical, high-stakes problems at Planet have created a powerful feedback loop.

I'm looking forward to focusing on Planet full-time over the summer, but I'm already excited for what the second and final year of my program will bring.
