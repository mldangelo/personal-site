If WWDC was about a new, more open Apple, Google I/O was about a new, more unified Google. The theme of the conference, held just down the road in San Francisco, was "Android everywhere."

The announcements of Android Wear, Android Auto, and Android TV made the strategy clear: Google wants to power every screen you interact with. It's an ambitious vision for a seamless, multi-device world where your digital life follows you from your phone to your watch to your car.

But the most impressive announcement, for me, was Material Design. It's a new, comprehensive design language that aims to unify the user experience across all of Google's products. It's beautiful, thoughtful, and based on a clear set of principles. The use of depth, shadow, and animation to create a sense of a tangible, physical world is a brilliant design metaphor. This is Google taking design seriously at a whole new level.

It was also fascinating to see the early demos of Android Wear. The focus on contextual, glanceable information is the right approach for a wearable device. It's not about shrinking a phone onto your wrist; it's about creating a new kind of interaction model.

Between Apple's new openness and Google's new design focus, it's clear that the competition in the mobile world is leading to better, more thoughtful products for everyone. The future of computing is being built right here, right now, and it's an incredible thing to witness.
