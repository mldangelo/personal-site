This month, the tech industry has been united in its call for the Senate to pass the USA Freedom Act. The bill, which aims to end the bulk collection of phone records by the NSA, is a direct response to the revelations from the Snowden documents.

It's a rare and powerful thing to see this industry speak with a single voice on a matter of public policy. Companies that are normally fierce competitors have come together to argue for the importance of privacy and the need for surveillance reform.

The USA Freedom Act is not a silver bullet. It's a compromise, and there are many who argue that it doesn't go far enough. But it is a significant step in the right direction. It would be the first time in decades that Congress has acted to rein in the surveillance powers of the intelligence community.

This is an issue that is deeply important to the future of the internet. The trust of our users is our most valuable asset. If people around the world believe that using our services means exposing their data to unchecked government surveillance, that trust will be eroded.

The fight for a free and open internet isn't just about technology; it's also about policy. And it's encouraging to see the tech industry stepping up and making its voice heard in that debate.
