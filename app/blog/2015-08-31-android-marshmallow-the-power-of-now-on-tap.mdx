Google has taken the wraps off the next version of Android, and it's called Marshmallow. While it's not a major design overhaul like Lollipop was, it's an update that is packed with smart, thoughtful features that will make Android a more powerful and intuitive operating system.

The headline feature is "Now on Tap." It's an extension of the Google Now predictive assistant that can be accessed from any screen. By long-pressing the home button, Now on Tap will scan the content of your screen and provide you with relevant information and actions.

If you're listening to a song, it will give you information about the artist. If you're reading an email about a movie, it will give you links to the trailer and showtimes. It's a powerful example of contextual computing, and it's a feature that could fundamentally change the way we interact with our phones.

Marshmallow also brings a number of other important improvements, including a new, more granular permissions model, official support for fingerprint scanners, and better power management with a feature called "Doze."

It's a mature and polished update that shows Google is focused on making Android smarter, faster, and more helpful. The future of mobile is not just about apps; it's about intelligent, proactive assistance, and with Marshmallow, Google is taking a big step in that direction.
