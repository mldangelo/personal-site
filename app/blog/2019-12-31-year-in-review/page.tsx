            <p>As 2019 comes to a close, it\'s time for my annual tradition of reflecting on the past year and setting intentions for the year ahead. This has been a year of building and scaling.</p>
            <h2>The Year in Summary</h2>
            <p><strong>Status</strong>: Arthena established</p>
            <p>This year has been defined by entrepreneurial challenges. Looking back at my goals from last year, I'm humbled by how much I still have to learn.</p>
            <h2>Professional Growth</h2>
            <p>Leading Arthena through rapid growth has been the challenge of a lifetime.</p>
            <p>This year's highlights:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Grew to millions in revenue</li>
              <li>Learned about art markets and quantitative finance</li>
              <li>Built an incredible team and culture</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Technical Learning</h2>
            <p>This year's technical exploration focused on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>JAMstack</strong>: Game-changing technology that shaped my work this year</li>
              <li><strong>WebAssembly</strong>: Bringing systems programming to the web</li>
              <li><strong>Privacy tech</strong>: Game-changing technology that shaped my work this year</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Personal Interests & Hobbies</h2>
            <h3>Space & Astronomy</h3>
            <p>Even as my career has moved away from space, I remain fascinated: First black hole image, Starship prototype, Chandrayaan-2 Moon mission. The commercialization of space is accelerating faster than I predicted.</p>
            <p>Less time for astrophotography these days, but I still catch major events. Every clear night is a reminder to look up.</p>
            <h3>Photography</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>African wildlife required learning patience</li>
