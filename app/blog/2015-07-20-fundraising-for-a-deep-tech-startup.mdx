We've officially entered the fundraising gauntlet. The past few weeks have been a series of meetings with angel investors and VCs, and it's been a crash course in a very specific type of communication: translating a complex, technical vision into a compelling business case.

Pitching Matroid is not like pitching a new photo-sharing app. We can't just show a few slick mockups. The core of our product is a deep learning model, a piece of technology that can feel like magic to the uninitiated. The challenge is to demystify that magic without getting lost in the technical weeds.

In one meeting, I might find myself drawing diagrams of neural networks on a whiteboard to explain how our technology works. In the next, I'm focusing entirely on the business problem we're solving, trying to convince an investor that there's a massive market for accessible computer vision.

It's a delicate balance. We have to prove that we have the technical chops to build something that few people in the world can, while also proving that we have the business acumen to turn that technology into a scalable company.

The most effective tool we have is the demo. When we show an investor how they can build their own "hot dog/not hot dog" detector in a matter of minutes, the lightbulb goes on. They see the power and the simplicity of what we're building. They see that we're not just selling a technology; we're selling a new and radically simpler way to interact with it. That's the story we're learning to tell.
