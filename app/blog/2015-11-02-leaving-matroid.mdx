This is one of the hardest posts I've ever had to write. A few months ago, I took a leap of faith and started a company with some of my closest friends. Today, I am stepping away from that company.

The decision to leave Matroid is a painful one, and it's not one that I've made lightly. The past few weeks have been a period of intense disagreement about the future direction of the company. As we've grappled with the feedback from our early customers, it has become clear that my co-founders and I have fundamentally different visions for the kind of company we want to build.

These are not disagreements about small details; they are deep, philosophical differences about the market we should be in, the product we should be building, and the culture we want to create.

In a startup, alignment of vision is everything. And when that alignment is gone, the best thing you can do for the company, and for each other, is to part ways.

I am incredibly proud of the technology we built, and I have immense respect for my co-founders. I truly wish them all the best.

For me, this is a moment of failure. It's a painful and humbling experience. But it's also a lesson. I've learned more about myself, about building a team, and about the realities of the startup world in the past few months than I have in years. And for that, I am grateful. Now, it's time to figure out what's next.
