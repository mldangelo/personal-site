The past few weeks have been a period of intense reflection and uncertainty. But out of the ashes of one dream, a new one has been born. I'm excited to announce that I'm starting a new company, and this time, I'm going all-in on my vision for the future of the art market.

The company is called **Arthena**. Our mission is to make art a more accessible and transparent asset class.

For too long, the world of art investment has been the exclusive domain of the ultra-wealthy. It's a market that is defined by high barriers to entry, a lack of data, and a reliance on personal connections.

We're going to change that.

Arthena will be a platform that allows anyone to invest in fine art. We're building a data-driven approach to art valuation, using machine learning to analyze decades of auction records and market data. We'll use that data to identify promising segments of the market, and then we'll create investment funds that allow our users to buy shares in a diversified portfolio of art.

It's an ambitious vision, and it combines my passions for data, finance, and art. It's a chance to build a company that can not only generate a great return for our investors, but can also bring a new level of transparency and accessibility to a market that desperately needs it.

The failure of my last venture was a painful lesson, but it has not extinguished my desire to build. I'm taking the lessons I've learned, and I'm channeling them into this new and exciting challenge. The journey starts today.
