The field of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has a long and rich history. For decades, it has been the primary tool for analyzing and visualizing spatial data. But it has always been a field dominated by manual processes and expert analysis.

Now, we're at the beginning of a revolution. The massive influx of data from sources like our satellite constellation, combined with the recent breakthroughs in machine learning, is set to transform the world of geospatial analysis.

The future isn't just about looking at a satellite image; it's about having a machine look at it and tell you what's there. It's about automatically identifying every building, road, and farm in an entire country. It's about tracking changes over time, not by having a human compare two images, but by having an algorithm do it for the entire planet, every single day.

This fusion of GIS and machine learning is at the core of what we're building at Planet. We're not just a satellite company; we're a data company. We're building the systems that will allow us to apply machine learning at a planetary scale.

It's a monumental challenge, but the potential is even greater. We're moving from mapping the world to understanding it, and that's a transformation that will have an impact on almost every industry.
