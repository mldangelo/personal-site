This week saw a major and unexpected announcement in the world of artificial intelligence: the formation of OpenAI. Backed by a billion dollars in commitments from a who's who of Silicon Valley, OpenAI is a non-profit research company with a unique and important mission: to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity.

This is a significant development for a few reasons.

First, it's a recognition that the long-term safety and ethical challenges of AI are not just the stuff of science fiction; they are real and pressing problems that we need to start working on today. The goal of OpenAI is not just to build powerful AI, but to build it in a way that is safe, transparent, and aligned with human values.

Second, its non-profit structure and its commitment to open-sourcing its research are a powerful counter-narrative to the trend of AI research being concentrated in a few large, for-profit corporations. The goal is to democratize AI and to prevent any single entity from gaining a dangerous monopoly on this transformative technology.

As someone who is building a company that uses AI, I find this announcement incredibly encouraging. It's a sign that the leaders of our industry are thinking about the long-term consequences of the technologies we're building. The work of OpenAI will be crucial in ensuring that the future of AI is one that is safe, equitable, and beneficial for everyone.
