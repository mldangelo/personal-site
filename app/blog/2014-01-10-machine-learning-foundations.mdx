The winter quarter has begun, and with it, the legendary CS229: Machine Learning. After a summer spent applying ML models at Facebook, I thought I had a decent grasp of the concepts. But being here, in a classroom where the focus is on deriving the algorithms from first principles, feels like I've been given a key to a whole new level of understanding.

It's one thing to call a library function for a Support Vector Machine. It's another thing entirely to derive the dual formulation, understand the kernel trick on a mathematical level, and grasp the elegant geometry of separating hyperplanes. The course is a beautiful symphony of linear algebra, probability theory, and optimization that shows you the machinery behind the magic.

This is exactly why I came to Stanford. It’s not just about learning what to do, but *why* you’re doing it. Building this solid theoretical foundation feels like learning the grammar of a language I’ve only been speaking colloquially. I have a feeling the insights from this course will resonate throughout my work for years to come.
