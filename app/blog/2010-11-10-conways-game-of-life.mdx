In between working on power budgets for the CubeSat and studying for my signals and systems class, I fell down a rabbit hole this week that I have to share. It's a concept that's been around since the 1970s, but it's new to me, and it feels incredibly profound. I'm talking about John Conway's Game of Life.

It's not a "game" in the way we think of video games. There are no players and no winning or losing. It's a cellular automatonâ€”a simulation that runs on a grid of cells, each of which can be either "alive" or "dead." The state of the grid evolves over time based on a few simple rules that are applied to each cell simultaneously.

The rules are elegant in their simplicity:

1.  **Underpopulation:** A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
2.  **Survival:** A live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3.  **Overpopulation:** A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
4.  **Reproduction:** A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.

That's it. Four rules.

When you set up an initial configuration of live cells and press "start," what happens next is nothing short of magic. You see patterns emerge. Some are static "still lifes" that never change. Others are "oscillators" that blink back and forth between two or more states.

But the most incredible things are the "spaceships." The most famous of these is the "glider," a small, five-cell pattern that moves diagonally across the grid forever. It's a particle in a digital universe, a stable pattern that propagates through the system. There are even "glider guns" that continuously generate new gliders.

Watching these complex, life-like behaviors emerge from four simple, local rules is a deeply humbling experience for an engineer. It's a powerful lesson in emergent complexity. It shows that you don't need a complex, top-down design to create a complex system.

It reminds me of the work we're doing on the CubeSat. We're building a system with a set of simple, well-defined rules for how it should operate, but the interaction of those rules in the complex environment of space will lead to behaviors that we can only try to predict.

The Game of Life is more than a curiosity. It's a beautiful, digital petri dish for exploring the nature of complexity, order, and life itself. If you've never played with it, I urge you to find a simulation online and lose a few hours. You won't regret it.
