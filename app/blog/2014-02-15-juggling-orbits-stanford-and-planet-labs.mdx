The initial adrenaline of starting at Planet and diving into a new quarter at Stanford is evolving into a sustainable rhythm. The best way to describe my days is as a series of intense context switches. One hour, I'm deriving a machine learning algorithm on a whiteboard in a Stanford classroom. The next, I'm in a meeting at Planet, discussing the thermal constraints of a satellite's power system.

It's demanding, but it's also incredibly rewarding. The two worlds feed into each other in ways I hadn't even anticipated. A lecture on optimization algorithms directly informs how I think about scheduling satellite imaging passes. A practical problem with data compression at work provides a perfect, real-world example for a theoretical concept from class.

The key, I'm finding, is ruthless prioritization and a strict calendar. My life is blocked out in 30-minute increments, from classes and meetings to study sessions and even meals. It's the only way to keep both orbits from decaying.

People have asked me if it's worth the stress. Absolutely. It's like getting a real-time, applied PhD. I'm not just learning the theory; I'm putting it into practice the same day. It's a challenging, exhausting, and deeply fulfilling way to learn.
