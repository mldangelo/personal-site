date: "2014-04-08"
summary: "The discovery of the Heartbleed bug in OpenSSL is the biggest security story of the year. It's a catastrophic failure that affects a huge portion of the internet, and a stark reminder that our digital world is built on a foundation of open-source code that is often under-appreciated and under-funded."

There's no other way to say it: the Heartbleed bug is a disaster. The vulnerability, which has existed in OpenSSL for two years, allows an attacker to read the memory of servers, exposing everything from private keys to user passwords. The scale of the fallout is almost impossible to comprehend.

This isn't a bug in a single application. It's a flaw in the foundational library that a huge portion of the internet uses to encrypt communication. It's like discovering that the locks used on millions of doors are fundamentally broken.

The past few days at Planet have been a frantic but methodical scramble to patch our systems, revoke old certificates, and ensure our infrastructure is secure. It's a fire drill that's happening at companies all over the world right now.

Beyond the immediate cleanup, Heartbleed forces a more profound conversation. It highlights the immense responsibility that rests on the shoulders of the maintainers of critical open-source projects. OpenSSL is a cornerstone of internet security, yet it's largely run by a small team of volunteers.

This vulnerability is a wake-up call. The industry, which reaps billions of dollars in value from open-source software, needs to find a sustainable way to support the foundational projects upon which we all depend. Our entire digital economy is built on this code. It's time we started investing in its security and stability.
