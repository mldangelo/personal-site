I'm back from the Small Satellite Conference, and I'm feeling energized and inspired. Giving my talk was a nerve-wracking but ultimately rewarding experience.

The audience was a mix of industry veterans, academics, and fellow startup founders. They were engaged, asked tough questions, and were genuinely curious about our approach. It was a great opportunity to share how we're applying lessons from the software world to the challenges of building and operating a large satellite constellation.

The best part of the conference, however, was the conversations that happened after the talk. I had dozens of people come up to me to discuss our use of cloud computing, our approach to automation, and our philosophy of rapid iteration.

It's clear that the aerospace industry is at an inflection point. The old ways of doing things are being challenged by a new wave of companies that are thinking differently about cost, scale, and speed.

It was an honor to be a part of that conversation and to share the work that the amazing team at Planet is doing. I'm already looking forward to next year.
