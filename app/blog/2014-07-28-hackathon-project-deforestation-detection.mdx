One of the best parts of the culture at Planet is the regular internal hackathon. It's a chance to step away from the day-to-day work, form a new team, and tackle a big, ambitious idea in a short amount of time.

For this hackathon, my team was inspired by the core of Planet's mission: to make global change visible, accessible, and actionable. We set out to build a proof-of-concept system for automatically detecting deforestation.

The concept is straightforward. We take two images of the same location from different days. We then use computer vision algorithms to align the images perfectly and compare them, looking for significant changes in the forest canopy.

The challenge is doing this accurately and at scale. We have to account for differences in lighting, seasonality, and cloud cover. We spent the hackathon building a pipeline that could ingest our imagery, run a change detection algorithm, and flag areas of potential deforestation for review.

By the end of the 24 hours, we had a working prototype. We could feed it a stream of imagery from the Amazon rainforest and see it successfully flag areas where the forest had been cleared.

It was a powerful demonstration of what's possible when you combine a unique dataset with the power of modern computer vision. It's still a long way from a fully-fledged product, but it was an inspiring glimpse into a future where we can monitor the health of our planet's ecosystems in near-real-time.
